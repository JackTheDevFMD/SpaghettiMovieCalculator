LARGE FISH.
DÉAGOL
(excited)
Sméagol, I've got one!
(he laughs)
I've got a fish, Sméagol!

Why?

called us. They cursed us and drove
us away.

Final Revision - October, 2003 3.
CONTINUED:
SMÉAGOL (V.O.) (cont’d)
And we wept, Precious. We wept, to
be so alone. And we forgot the taste
of bread, the sound of trees, the
softness of the wind ... We even
forgot our own name.
(in a choking cough)
Gollum! Gollum!
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM in the CAVE staring at the RING in his hand.
GOLLUM
It’s mine! My own. It came to me.
SMÉAGOL
(ecstatic)
My Precious.

scars of RECENT FIRES. The DARK MORGUL VALLEY disappears up
towards the MOUNTAINS.
SETTLE ON: FRODO and SAM in a FILTHY CULVERT.
SAM twitches in a RESTLESS SLEEP. But FRODO is awake ... His
hand trails down to the CHAIN around his NECK...
A SUDDEN HISS! FRODO quickly hides the RING as GOLLUM peers at
them with GLEAMING EYES.
GOLLUM
Wake up! Wake up! Wake up, sleepies!
We must go, yes, we must go at once!
SAM STIRS, looks at FRODO...
SAM
Haven't you had any sleep, Mr. Frodo?
FRODO shakes his HEAD.
SAM (cont’d)
I've gone and had too much!

Final Revision - October, 2003 4.
CONTINUED:
SAM looks at the dead, BROWN TWILIGHT, below the LOWERING CLOUD.
SAM (cont’d)
It must be getting late.
FRODO
No ... no it isn't. It isn't midday
yet. The days are growing darker.
The GROUND suddenly QUIVERS, as a ROLLING, RUMBLING NOISE ECHOES
down the VALLEY.
GOLLUM
Come on, must go, no time...
SAM
Not before Mr. Frodo's had something
to eat.
GOLLUM
... no time to lose, silly.
SAM shoots GOLLUM a HOSTILE LOOK and turns back to rummage in
his KNAPSACK. He holds up a piece of dried LEMBAS BREAD to
FRODO.
SAM
Here.
FRODO
What about you?
SAM
(lying badly)
I'm not hungry – leastways, not for
Lembas bread.
FRODO
Sam.
SAM
(confessing)
Alright. We don't have that much
left.

SAM (cont’d)
We have to be careful or we're
going to run out. You go ahead and

enough.

FRODO
For what?
SAM
The journey home.
FRODO says nothing.
EXT. CULVERT, VALE OF MORGUL - DAY
WIDE: FRODO and SAM follow GOLLUM as he leads them on the

Come, Hobbitses. Very close now. Very
close to Mordor! No safe places here.
Hurry! Shhh.
EXT. THE FOREST OF ISENGARD - DAY
GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, THÉODEN, and GIMLI through dark
woodland...
The MOVING FOREST of FANGORN ... opens before them ... creating

Far off, half veiled in the swirling STEAM, the TOWER of ORTHANC
stands ... Unbroken by the storm. Pale waters lap about its
feet.
ANGLE ON: TWO SMALL HOBBITS are sitting on the SMASHED WALL ...
MERRY AND PIPPIN! SPREAD before them is a feast of BREADS,
MEATS, and WINE. They PUFF on long pipes as they lie back in the
SUN.
PIPPIN
I feel like I'm back at the Green
Dragon after a hard day's work.
MERRY
Only, you've never done a hard
day's work.
MERRY cuts PIPPIN off before he can respond in kind.
MERRY (cont’d)
Welcome, my Lords, to Isengard.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI stare at the SIGHT
before them...
GIMLI
You young rascals! A merry hunt
you've led us on, and now we find
you, feasting and smoking.
PIPPIN
(mouth full)
We are sitting on a field of
victory, enjoying a few well-earned
comforts. The salted pork is
particularly good.
GIMLI
(suddenly interested)
Salted pork?
GANDALF
(shaking his head)
Hobbits.

MERRY
We're under orders, from Treebeard,
who's taken over management of
Isengard.
WIDE: GANDALF leads the company through the flotsam and jetsam
which floats upon the muddied waters surrounding the TOWER ...
TREEBEARD, the GIANT ENT, strides towards them, ALARMING all but
GANDALF.
TREEBEARD
Burarum ... Young Master Gandalf.
I'm glad you've come. Wood and water,
stock and stone, I can master, but
there’s a Wizard to be managed here
... locked in his tower.
GANDALF
And there Saruman must remain,
under your guard, Treebeard.
GIMLI
Let's just have his head and be
done with it.
GANDALF stares up the long length of the DARK TOWER...
GANDALF
(quietly)
No. He has no power any more.
THE OLD ENT nods his head wisely...
TREEBEARD
The filth of Saruman is washing
Away ... Trees will come back to live
Here, young trees ... wild trees.
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, his eye caught by something lying in the WATER
ANGLE ON: The MUDDY waters GLOWING with a golden light...

horse and picked up – the PALANTÍR!

TREEBEARD (cont’d)
Well bless my bark!
GANDALF
(urgent)
Peregrin Took! I'll take that, my lad.
PIPPIN doesn’t move, his eyes staring in wonder at the smooth
black stone...
GANDALF (cont’d)
Quickly, now!
RELUCTANTLY, PIPPIN hands the PALANTÍR to GANDALF ... who
immediately smothers it in his cloak.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF looks back at PIPPIN ... troubled.

CITY of EDORAS...

CUT TO:
INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - EVENING
WIDE: A ROARING FIRE: a LAMB ROASTING on a SPIT; LONG TABLES
laden with FOOD; BARRELS of WINE; a banquet is laid – ready for
the returning soldiers.
THÉODEN
Tonight we remember those who gave
their blood to defend this country.
Hail the victorious dead!
ANGLE ON: Amidst the sheering crowd, ÉOWYN moves towards ARAGORN
... As she proffers the CHALICE, their eyes meet.
ÉOWYN
Westu Aragorn hál.

Final Revision - October, 2003 9.

ÉOWYN watches as ARAGORN moves away ... a voice speaks in her
ear.
THÉODEN
I am happy for you.
ÉOWYN looks at her UNCLE, as THÉODEN follows her gaze.
THÉODEN
He is an honorable man.
ÉOWYN
(smiling)
You are both honorable Men.
THÉODEN
It was not Théoden of Rohan who led
our people to victory.
ÉOWYN looks at him questioningly, disturbed by his tone.
THÉODEN (cont’d)
Don't listen to me. You are young,
and tonight is for you.
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN watches concerned as her UNCLE moves away.
ANGLE ON: MERRY & PIPPIN are in full voice, on top of one of the
TABLES ... both hold very large mugs of ALE in their hands.
MERRY & PIPPIN
(singing)
Oh, you can search – up and down
As many lands as can be found
But you'll never find a beer so brown
As the one we drink in our home town
You can keep your fancy ales
You can drink them by the flagon
But the only brew, for the brave and true,
Comes from the Green Dragon!
ANGLE ON: GANDALF laughing and clapping the HOBBITS. ARAGORN
steps up beside him, SMILING at the floorshow.

ARAGORN
No news of Frodo?
GANDALF
No word ... nothing.
ARAGORN
We still have time.
GANDALF turns quickly to ARAGORN.
ARAGORN (cont’d)
Every day Frodo moves closer to
Mordor.
GANDALF watches his friend’s face ... seeking reassurance.
GANDALF
Do we know that?
ARAGORN
(gently)
What does your heart tell you?
GANDALF
(with a small smile)
That Frodo is alive.
(to himself)
Yes - yes, he is alive.
EXT. MORGUL VALLEY – NIGHT
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM lie asleep amidst scrubby bushes near a
stagnant pool. SMÉAGOL lies nearby, muttering in his sleep.
SMÉAGOL
Too risky. Too risky. The thieves!
They stole it from us. Kill them ...
kill them ... kill them both!
SMÉAGOL wakes suddenly, shaking, his face drenched in SWEAT,
eyes wide in horror.
SMÉAGOL (cont’d)
No!

Final Revision - October, 2003 11.

GOLLUM
(hissed whisper)
Shhh! Quiet!
SMÉAGOL’S features suddenly transform into the MALEVOLENT face
of GOLLUM!
GOLLUM (cont’d)
Mustn’t waken them, mustn't ruin
it now!
SMÉAGOL casts a quick glance over his SHOULDER to the SLEEPING
figures of FRODO and SAM as he clambers off to his ROCK ...
silently sidling towards the EDGE of the STAGNANT POOL.
SMÉAGOL
They knows, they knows, they
suspects us!
SMÉAGOL stares into the MURKY depths of the WATER.
The SURFACE RIPPLES as the face of GOLLUM appears as SMÉAGOL’S
REFLECTION.
GOLLUM
What's it saying, my Precious, my
love? Is Sméagol losing his nerve??
SMÉAGOL
No! Not! Never!! Sméagol hates nasty
Hobbitses! Sméagol wants to see them –
dead!
GOLLUM
And we will ... Sméagol did it once...
(sly)
... He can do it again.
FLASH INSERT: SMÉAGOL choking DÉAGOL ... Fingers locked tight
around his THROAT.
GOLLUM (cont’d)
It's ours - ours!

SMÉAGOL
We must get the Precious. We must
get it back.
GOLLUM
Patience, patience, my love. First,
we must lead them to her.
SMÉAGOL
We lead them to the windy stairs.
GOLLUM
(prompting)
Yes, the stairs ... and then?
SMÉAGOL
Up, up, up, up the stairs we go ...
until we come to...
(naughty excitement)
... the Tunnel!
GOLLUM
(quiet)
And when they go in, there's no
coming out. She's always hungry, she
always needs to feed. She must eat.
All she gets is filthy Orcses.
SMÉAGOL
And they doesn't taste very nice, does
they, Precious?
GOLLUM
No ...not very nice at all, my love.
She hungers for sweeter meats...
CLOSE ON: SAM ... his EYES flicker OPEN...
GOLLUM
“Hobbit meat.” And when She throws
away the bones and the empty clothes,
then we will find it...
SMÉAGOL
And take it for me!

For us...
SMÉAGOL
Yes, we, we meant for us...
(choking cough)
Gollum! Gollum!
GOLLUM
(sly)
The Precious will be ours, once the
Hobbitses are dead!
SUDDEN ANGLE ON: SAM’S image mirrored in the water as he SMACKS
GOLLUM on the HEAD with his POT!
SAM
(yelling)
You treacherous little toad!
SAM drops the POT and FLINGS himself ON TOP of GOLLUM! GOLLUM
SCREAMS ... his ARMS and LEGS FLAILING WILDLY!
GOLLUM
(crying)
No! Not! Help! Master!
ANGLE ON: FRODO staggers over to SAM and PULLS HIM OFF GOLLUM.
FRODO
No, Sam! Leave him alone!
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM, huddled on the ground, WHIMPERING and SOBBING.
SAM
(fuming)
I heard it from his own mouth ... he
means to murder us!

SMÉAGOL
Never! Sméagol wouldn't hurt a fly!
He’s a horrid, fat Hobbit who hates
Sméagol and who makes up nasty lies!
SAM makes for SMÉAGOL again ... with a look of MURDEROUS RAGE.
SAM
You miserable little maggot! I'll
stove your head in!
FRODO grabs SAM’S ARM.
FRODO
Sam...
SAM
Call me a liar! You're a liar!
FRODO
Sam! If you scare him off, we're lost.
SAM pulls away from FRODO...
SAM
I don't care! I can't do it, Mr. Frodo.
I won't wait around for him to kill us!
FRODO
(fierce whisper)
I'm not sending him away.
SAM stares at FRODO ... at a loss.
SAM
You don't see it, do you? He's
a villain!
FRODO
We can't do this by ourselves,
Sam. Not without a guide. I need
you on my side.
ANGLE ON: SAM, his face softening.

You must trust me.
FRODO beckons to GOLLUM.
FRODO (cont’d)
Come, Sméagol.
GOLLUM turns slowly, staring at SAM through hooded, HATE-FILLED
EYES ... and SMILES.
CUT TO:
EXT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL – EARLY DAWN
ARAGORN joins LEGOLAS on the STEPS to the golden HALL, oblivious
to the CHILL WIND ... they look out across the SLEEPING CITY to
the LOOMING MOUNTAIN RANGE BEYOND ... DARK CLOUDS mark the sky.
LEGOLAS
The stars are veiled. Something stirs
in the East ... a sleepless malice.
LEGOLAS looks at ARAGORN ... realization in his face.
LEGOLAS (cont’d)
The eye of the enemy is moving.
INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS – EARLY DAWN
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN ... he is AWAKE! He sits up ... ANXIOUS,
FIDGETY...

PIPPIN is undeterred...
MERRY sits up, a worried look on his face.
MERRY (cont’d)
Pippin? Pippin? Pippin! What are
you doing?
With quick stealth, PIPPIN lifts the WRAPPED PALANTÍR from
GANDALF’S grasp...
MERRY (cont’d)
Pippin, are you mad?
PIPPIN
I just want to look at it. Just one
more time.
MERRY
Put it back! Put – it – back!
PIPPIN unwraps the PALANTÍR and as MERRY looks on HORRIFIED, he
gazes intently into it.
MERRY (cont’d)
Pippin!
As PIPPIN lays his hands on the CRYSTAL, a SICKLY PALE light
slowly spreads from the GLASS BALL onto PIPPIN’S FACE ... his
EYES WIDEN.
MERRY (cont’d)
Pippin!

LEGOLAS

He is here.
INT. EDORAS, SLEEPING QUARTERS - NIGHT
PIPPIN suddenly starts to HYPERVENTILATE ... He STAGGERS
BACKWARDS, PALANTÍR held rigidly before him...
THE GREAT EYE OF SAURON seems to LEAP from the FIRE ... PIPPIN
is bathed in the FIERY RED LIGHT.
PIPPIN sinks to his KNEES, his mouth open in a soundless SCREAM
... He FALLS BACKWARDS, powerless to release the FIERY GLOBE.
MERRY
Help! Someone help him!
GANDALF wakes with start! Just as ARAGORN enters, and wrenches
the PALANTÍR from PIPPIN’S HANDS ... PIPPIN FALLS to the FLOOR!
... ARAGORN spins away, reeling backwards, the PALANTÍR falling
from his HANDS...
The PALANTÍR rolls across the FLOOR, causing EVERYONE in the
room to COWER BACK.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF throws a BLANKET over it, ANGRY DISBELIEF on
his face! He rounds on PIPPIN.
GANDALF
Fool of a Took!
GANDALF lifts the HOBBIT’S SLUMPED HEAD.
MERRY
Pippin!
PIPPIN is trembling ... GANDALF calms him...
PIPPIN
Gandalf! Forgive me.
GANDALF
Look at me! What did you see?

A tree ... There was a white tree ...
in a courtyard of stone... It was dead!
FLASH INSERT: A lone white tree surrounded by flames.
PIPPIN (cont’d)
The city was burning...
GANDALF
Minas Tirith??
(to PIPPIN)
Is that what you saw?
PIPPIN
(terrified)
I saw ... I saw him ... I can hear
his voice in my head.
GANDALF
What did you tell him? Speak!
PIPPIN
He asked me my name, I didn't
Answer ... he hurt me...
CLOSE ON: GANDALF stares at PIPPIN with a FRIGHTENING
INTENSITY...
GANDALF
What did you tell him about Frodo
and the Ring?
INT. EDORAS, GOLDEN HALL - DAY
THÉODEN stands in the GOLDEN HALL, gravely listening to GANDALF
... ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI look on...
GANDALF
There was no lie in Pippin's eyes; a fool,
but an honest fool he remains. He told
Sauron nothing of Frodo and the Ring.
ANGLE ON: GIMLI lets out a sigh of relief.

Final Revision - October, 2003 19.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF turns to look at THÉODEN.
GANDALF (cont’d)
We've been strangely fortunate. What Pippin
saw in the Palantír was a glimpse of our
enemy's plan.
GANDALF looks from one to the other of the gathered company.
GANDALF (cont’d)
Sauron moves to strike the city of Minas
Tirith. His defeat at Helm's Deep showed
our enemy one thing.
The WIZARD turns towards ARAGORN...
GANDALF (cont’d)
The Heir of Elendil has come forth. Men are
not as weak as he supposed. There is
courage still - strength enough left to
challenge him.
THÉODEN listens intently, saying nothing.
GANDALF (cont’d)
(warningly)
Sauron fears this. He will not risk the
peoples of Middle-earth uniting under one
banner. He will raze Minas Tirith to the
ground before he sees the return of the
King.
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN ... he knows GANDALF SPEAKS THE TRUTH.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF rounds on THÉODEN.
GANDALF (cont’d)
If the beacons of Gondor are lit, Rohan
must be ready for war!
THÉODEN holds GANDALF’S gaze.

Tell me. Why should we ride to the aid
of those who did not come to ours?

THÉODEN (cont’d)
What do we owe Gondor?
ARAGORN
(low and urgent)
I will go.
GANDALF
(hurried)
No!
ARAGORN
They must be warned!
GANDALF
They will be.
(low voice, to ARAGORN)
You must come to Minas Tirith by
another road.
(cryptic)
Follow the river, look to the black ships.
(louder, to all)
Understand this, things are now in
motion that cannot be undone.
GANDALF turns on his heel ... and stares at a surprised PIPPIN.
GANDALF (cont’d)
I ride for Minas Tirith! And I
won't be going alone!

GANDALF
Of all the inquisitive Hobbits, Peregrin

PIPPIN catches up to MERRY.
PIPPIN
(worried)
Where are we going?
MERRY
Why did you look - why do you
always have to look?
PIPPIN
(subdued)
I don't know. I can't help it.
MERRY turns away...
MERRY
You never can.
PIPPIN
(lightly)
I'm sorry, all right? I won't do
it again.
This is too much for MERRY. He turns on PIPPIN.
MERRY
Don't you understand ... the Enemy
thinks you have the Ring ... he's
going to be looking for you, Pip.
They have to get you out of here!
PIPPIN
And you. You're coming with me ...
Merry?
MERRY
Come on!

SHADOWFAX as GANDALF hurriedly prepares to leave...
PIPPIN
(nervous)
How far is Minas Tirith?
GANDALF
Three days ride, as the Nazgûl flies,
and you better hope we don't have one
of those on our tail.
MERRY thrusts a SMALL PACKAGE into PIPPIN’S HAND...
MERRY
Here - something for the road.
PIPPIN stares down at the leather-bound bundle of PIPE-WEED.
PIPPIN
The last of the Longbottom Leaf.
MERRY
I know you've run out ... You
smoke too much, Pip.
PIPPIN
But we'll see each other soon?
A WORRIED MERRY exchanges glances with GANDALF.
PIPPIN (cont’d)
Won’t we?
MERRY
I don't know... I don't know

EXT. RIVENDELL FOREST - DAY
WIDE: ARWEN – escorted by a SMALL ENTOURAGE of ELVES – rides
through the gathering darkness of a PINE FOREST.
ELROND (V.O.)
Take her by the safest road. A ship
lies anchored in the Grey Havens. It
waits to carry her across the sea ...
the last journey of Arwen Undómiel.
SLOW MOTION: As ARWEN rides through the FOREST, the FIGURE of a
SMALL BOY of about 5 SUDDENLY runs across the path in front of
her.
ARWEN reigns in ASFALOTH ... something about the BOY intrigues
her – but she does not know why...
(CONTINUED)
Final Revision - October, 2003 24.
CONTINUED:
As ARWEN watches the BOY move away, the TREES begin to thin ...
the BOY continues running. One by one, the TREES TRANSFORM into
TALL WHITE PILLARS.
ARWEN’S POV: The BOY now stands within a VISION of the majestic
architecture of the great Gondorian city of MINAS TIRITH.
A SILHOUETTED FIGURE appears in the distance and moves towards
the CHILD ... the BOY runs to the FIGURE.
ARWEN watches as the FIGURE holds out its arms – swinging the
LAUGHING CHILD into the AIR...
The Figure turns to reveal ... ARAGORN, a little older, dressed
in the casual finery of a GONDORIAN NOBLE.
CLOSE ON: The CHILD, now in ARAGORN’S ARMS, looks directly at
ARWEN ... it is a QUIET LOOK filled with INFINITE SADNESS.
ARWEN’S eyes drop to the CHILD’S CHEST ... around the CHILD’S
neck hangs the EVENSTAR...
CLOSE ON: ARWEN as she realizes she is staring at a future that
can never be, the CHILD she and ARAGORN will never have.
INSERT: ELROND speaking to his daughter...
ELROND (V.O.) (cont’d)
Arwen, there is nothing for you here ...
only death.
ARWEN shuts her eyes ... when she opens them again, the VISION
is gone ... she is staring at DARK TREES once more.

ELROND
Arwen?
ANGLE ON: ARWEN breathing hard, walking towards ELROND with
fierce light in her eyes.
ARWEN
You have the gift of foresight – tell
me what you have seen.
CLOSE ON: ELROND - his face grim.
ELROND
I looked into your future and I
saw death.
ARWEN
There is also life.
Her father turns away...
ARWEN (cont’d)
You saw there was a child...
you saw my son.

That future is almost gone.
ARWEN
But it is not lost...
ELROND
Nothing is certain.

Some things are certain. If I leave
him now, I will regret it forever.

Ada, it is time.

From the ashes a fire shall be woken,
a light from the shadow shall spring,
renewed shall be blade that was broken...

ISILDUR brandishes NARSIL at SAURON.

ELROND
Your hands are cold.
(distressed)
The life of the Eldar is leaving you.
CLOSE ON: ELROND’S despair is plain...
ELROND (cont’d)
It has begun.

ANGLE ON: PIPPIN, huddled in front of GANDALF, the WIND sailing
through his hair.
GANDALF
We have just passed into the realm
of Gondor.
EXT. MINAS TIRITH – DAWN
ANGLE ON: SHADOWFAX gallops up onto a LOW RIDGE...
ANGLE ON: Before them is the DARK MASS of Mount Mindolluin, its
tall WHITE FACE whitening in the RISING SUN. Upon its out-thrust
knee is the Guarded City: MINAS TIRITH.
With SEVEN WALLS OF WHITE STONE, so strong and old that it seems
to have been not built, MINAS TIRITH looks carven by giants out
of the bones of the earth.
GANDALF
Minas Tirith ... City of the Kings.
Suddenly, the SUN climbs over the eastern hills, and sends forth
a SHAFT OF SUNLIGHT that GLEAMS against the face of the CITY.
The TOWER OF ECTHELION stands high within the topmost walls.
WHITE BANNERS break and FLUTTER from the BATTLEMENTS in the
morning breeze.

ANGLE ON: The stares of frightened GONDORIANS as GANDALF and
PIPPIN gallop through the WINDING STREETS...
AERIAL SHOT: SHADOWFAX, carrying GANDALF and PIPPIN up towards
the 7th LEVEL.
MINAS TIRITH is built in 7 LEVELS – each behind a CIRCULAR
DEFENSIVE WALL. Each level rises – the city reaches a height of
nearly 1000 FEET on its TOPMOST LEVEL.
A towering BASTION of NATURAL ROCK – shaped like a sharp ship’s
prow – bisects the city from the 2nd LEVEL to the TOP.
EXT. MINAS TIRITH, COURT OF THE KINGS – DAY
SHADOWFAX arrives at a GREAT CITADEL on the SUMMIT of the CITY –
1000 FEET above the PELENNOR FIELDS.
GANDALF and PIPPIN dismount, leaving the GUARDS of the CITADEL
to tend to SHADOWFAX. GANDALF hurries off...
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN as he takes in his surroundings, his eye caught
by a DEAD TREE that stands in the middle of the COURT, FOUR
SOLEMN CITADEL GUARDS standing sentry around it.
PIPPIN
(whisper)
It's the tree.
(hurrying after GANDALF)
Gandalf! Gandalf!
GANDALF
Yes, the White Tree of Gondor. The
tree of the King.
GANDALF leads PIPPIN across a FLAT COURT of WHITE STONES,
surrounded by GREEN LAWNS ... towards a GREAT HALL beneath the
GLEAMING TOWER.
GANDALF (cont’d)
Lord Denethor, however, is not the king.
He is a steward, only. A caretaker of
the throne.
GANDALF lowers his voice, as they approach the TOWER HALL.
(CONTINUED)
Final Revision - October, 2003 30.
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
(quietly)
Now, listen carefully. Lord Denethor is
Boromir's father. To give him news of
his beloved son's death would be most
unwise ... And do not mention Frodo ...
Or the Ring ... And say nothing of
Aragorn, either.
(hesitates)
In fact, it's better if you don't
speak at all, Peregrin Took.
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, suitably chastened, nods.
INT. MINAS TIRITH TOWER HALL – DAY
ANGLE ON: A LONG SOLEMN HALL ... with ROWS of BLACK MARBLE
PILLARS. Between the pillars stand a company of TALL KINGS
carved in cold STONE.
GANDALF strides down the HALL, with PIPPIN following obediently
behind.
At the FAR END, upon a DAIS OF MANY STEPS, sits a LARGE, EMPTY
THRONE ... and on the wall is the IMAGE of a FLOWERING WHITE
TREE set in GEMS.
At the Foot of the DAIS, in a small STONE CHAIR, sits an OLD
MAN, gazing at his lap: DENETHOR – the Lord Steward of GONDOR.
GANDALF
Hail Denethor, son of Ecthelion,
Lord and Steward of Gondor.
DENETHOR does not look up as GANDALF and PIPPIN approach.
GANDALF (cont’d)
I come with tidings in this dark
hour - and with counsel.
DENETHOR slowly raises COLD EYES...
DENETHOR
(bitter)
Perhaps you come to explain this?
(CONTINUED)
Final Revision - October, 2003 31.
CONTINUED:
DENETHOR holds up BOROMIR’S BROKEN HORN...
DENETHOR (cont’d)
Perhaps you come to tell me why
my son is dead.
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN remembering...
INSERT IMAGE: BOROMIR, as URUK-HAI arrows thud into his body, he
falls to his KNEES...
PIPPIN starts forward unable to say nothing...
PIPPIN
Boromir died to save us ... my kinsman
and me ... he fell, defending us from
many foes.
CLOSE ON: DENETHOR, pain flickers in his eyes.
GANDALF
(hurried whisper)
Pippin!
PIPPIN drops to his knee offering DENETHOR his SWORD...
PIPPIN
I offer you my service, such as it
is, in payment of this debt.
DENETHOR looks at PIPPIN blankly, overcome with grief.
GANDALF
(to PIPPIN)
Get up!
(addressing DENETHOR)
My Lord, there will be a time to grieve for
Boromir, but it is not now. War is coming
... the Enemy is on your doorstep. As
Steward, you are charged with the defense of
this city. Where are Gondor's armies?
DENETHOR’S gaze turns slowly on GANDALF...

Final Revision - October, 2003 32.
CONTINUED: (2)
GANDALF (cont’d)
You still have friends - You are not alone
in this fight. Send word to Théoden of
Rohan. Light the beacons.
DENETHOR smiles at GANDALF, as if amused by something.
DENETHOR
(softly)
You think you are wise, Mithrandir,
yet for all your subtleties you have
not wisdom. Do you think the eyes of
the White Tower are blind? I have seen
more than you know. With your left hand
you would use me as a shield against
Mordor, and with your right you would
seek to supplant me.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF looks shocked. DENETHOR’S eyes NARROW.
DENETHOR (cont’d)
(contemptuous)
I know who rides with Théoden of Rohan.
Oh, yes. Word has reached my ears of
this Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and I
tell you now, I will not bow to this
Ranger from the North, last of a ragged
house long bereft of Lordship.
GANDALF
(stung)
Authority is not given you to deny
the return of the King – Steward!
DENETHOR
(explosive)
The rule of Gondor is mine, and no other's!
CLOSE ON: PIPPIN, horrified. GANDALF looks at DENETHOR closely
for a moment, then turns on his heel to leave. PIPPIN follows.
GANDALF
Come.
GANDALF and PIPPIN stride from the TOWER HALL ... DENETHOR
slumps back into his SEAT.
Final Revision - October, 2003 33.
INT. MINAS TIRITH, PIPPIN’S QUARTERS - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN is carefully laying out a SMALL UNIFORM of the
ROYAL GUARD on a bed.
PIPPIN
So I imagine this is just a ceremonial
Position ... I mean, they don't actually
expect me to do any fighting ... do they?
WIDE: GANDALF STANDING QUIETLY on a BALCONY that overlooks the
GREAT CITY.
GANDALF
You're in the service of the Steward
Now - You're going to have to do as
you're told, Peregrin Took...
(under his breath)
Guard of the Citadel!
EXT. MINAS TIRITH BALCONY – NIGHT
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN as he stares up at the vast NIGHT SKY.
PIPPIN
It's so quiet.
GANDALF watches the young HOBBIT.
GANDALF
It's the deep breath before the plunge.
PIPPIN
I don't want to be in a battle ... but
waiting on the edge of one I can't
escape is even worse.
(tense)
Is there any hope, Gandalf - for Frodo
and Sam?
GANDALF joins PIPPIN as they look towards the distant, jagged
MOUNTAINS of MORDOR...
(CONTINUED)
Final Revision - October, 2003 34.

GANDALF
There never was much hope.
PIPPIN looks up at him, unnerved. GANDALF gives him a small,
self-deprecating smile...
GANDALF (cont’d)
Just a fool's hope.
GANDALF and PIPPIN share a quiet moment as they stare out
towards the FIERY SKY over MORDOR.
GANDALF (V.O.)
(grim)
Our enemy is almost ready, his full
strength gathered. Not only Orcs, but
men as well.

Mercenaries from the coast ... All will
answer Mordor's call.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF ... he is almost talking to himself now...
like a man unable to prevent a sure disaster.
GANDALF
This will be the end of Gondor as we
know it. Here the hammerstroke will
fall the hardest.
INSERT IMAGE: The BATTLE-SCARRED CITY of OSGILIATH – last
bastion between MINAS TIRITH and MORDOR...
GANDALF (V.O.)
If the river is taken, if the garrison
at Osgiliath falls, the last defense
of this city will be gone.

PIPPIN
But we have the White Wizard, that's got to
count for something.
GANDALF looks down at PIPPIN, he says nothing...
PIPPIN (cont’d)

Gandalf?
GANDALF stares into the distance as if seeing something in his
mind’s eye.
INSERT IMAGE: A TOWERING, HOODED FIGURE, DRESSED in BLACK, is
being dressed in ARMOUR by attendant ORCS...
GANDALF (V.O.)
Sauron has yet to release his deadliest
servant ... The one who will lead
Mordor’s armies in war, the one they
say no living man can kill.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF still staring intently as if facing his enemy
in person.
GANDALF
The Witch-King of Angmar...

PIPPIN)
You've met him before...

ROUGH-HEWN ROAD ... GOLLUM CAREFULLY peers OVER the lip of the
GULLY...
ANGLE ON: MINAS MORGUL, a MASSIVE DEAD CITY, set upon a ROCKY
KNEE at the HEAD OF THE Morgul Valley. CORRUPT and LOATHSOME, it
glows with a SICKLY LUMINOUS LIGHT – like a CORPSE CANDLE.
TWO HUGE, BESTIAL STONE STATUES guard the BRIDE that leads to
the CITY...
GOLLUM
The Dead City, very nasty place,
full of ... enemies.
GOLLUM, FRODO and SAM hurry from their COVER scampering in the
SHADOWS towards MINAS MORGUL...
GOLLUM
Quick! Quick! They will see, they
will see.
CLOSE ON: FRODO ... he LOOKS UP at the HIDEOUS STATUES. His
SENSES START REELING.
GOLLUM (cont’d)
Come away, come away. Look! We have
found it.
FRODO and SAM look AGHAST at the sight of a NARROW, NEARVERTICAL
STAIRCASE, cut into the ROCK-FACE ... Directly in FRONT

the razor-like MOUNTAINS OF MORDOR.
GOLLUM (cont’d)
The secret stairs ... climb!
SUDDENLY! FRODO staggers across the ROAD ... as if some FORCE,
other than his own will, is at work! He lurches towards the
BRIDGE ... towards MINAS MORGUL!
SAM
No, Mr. Frodo!
GOLLUM
(desperate)
Not that way!
SAM runs after FRODO, catching him in his arms as he STUMBLES.
GOLLUM (cont’d)
What's it doing?
SAM
No!
SAM and GOLLUM pull FRODO from the BRIDGE.
FRODO
(disoriented)
They're calling me!
FRODO falls to the GROUND.
AT THAT MOMENT: the GROUND QUIVERS, and a great RUMBLING NOISE
rolls across the ground and ECHOES in the mountains.
The cold, dull MORGUL VALLEY is suddenly VIOLENT and FIERCE, as
UPRUSHING FLAME springs from MOUNT DOOM.

SHIVERING, rising swiftly to a PIERCING PITCH beyond the range
of hearing. The terrible CRY ends, falling back through a long
sickening WAIL, to SILENCE.
ANGLE ON: FRODO slowly RAISES HIS HEAD ... across the NARROW
VALLEY, directly opposite the HOBBITS, the LORD OF THE NAZGÛL –
the WITCH KING – suddenly RISES UP out of the DEAD CITY on his

Across the deeps of the Sea.
The WITCH KING SWOOPS down the VALLEY to join the HEAD of his

now to be done. Another opportunity for
one of the Shire-folk to prove their
great worth!

riding toward MINAS TIRITH ... in the SKY above DARK SHAPES
pursue them...
ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY, from on HIGH, the NAZGÛL strike!
TILT DOWN ... following the NAZGÛL as it SWOOPS out of LOWLYING,

GANDALF thunders into view, raising his STAFF...
A SHAFT OF WHITE LIGHT suddenly stabs upwards! The NAZGÛL
SWERVES AWAY from the LIGHT, as it pierces the LOW CLOUD!
For a BRIEF MOMENT, SUNLIGHT streams through the hole onto
PELENNOR FIELDS ... The NAZGÛL circle away from the SUN RAYS,
swiftly spiraling higher and higher.

It is as the Lord Denethor predicted -
long has he foreseen this doom!

EXT. CIRITH UNGOL STAIRS – NIGHT
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM following GOLLUM up the dizzying
STAIRWAY, carved into the SHEER CLIFF.
The STEPS are NARROW, UNEVENLY SPACED, and many are BROKEN. They
are so STEEP that FRODO and SAM climb as if on a LADDER, their
desperate FINGERS clinging to the STEPS ABOVE – trying not to
look at the LONG BLACK FALL below them.
ANGLE ON: FRODO’S foot slips and for a brief moment he is

HIS SWORD!

SAM (cont’d)
Get back you! Don't touch him!
ANGLE ON: SAM’S horrified face as...
GOLLUM’S out-stretched HAND suddenly GRASPS FRODO’S ARM pulling
him SAFELY onto the LEDGE.

CLOSE ON: GOLLUM creeps CLOSE to FRODO and WHISPERS in his ear:
GOLLUM (cont’d)

He wants it - he needs it! Sméagol sees
it in his eyes. Very soon, he will ask
you for it - you will see ... the Fat
One will take it from you.

I do not think we should so lightly
abandon the outer defenses; defenses
that your brother long held intact.
FARAMIR
What would you have me do?
DENETHOR
I will not yield the River and Pelennor
unfought - Osgiliath must be retaken.
FARAMIR
My Lord, Osgiliath is overrun.
DENETHOR
Much must be risked in war. Is there a
captain here who still has the courage
to do his Lord's will?
CLOSE ON: FARAMIR as he finally realises the truth.
FARAMIR
(quietly)
You wish now that our places had been
exchanged, that I had died and Boromir

then...

SAM
What are you up to? Sneaking off, are we?
SMÉAGOL
(prevaricating)
Sneaking? Sneaking? Fat Hobbit is always
so polite. Sméagol shows them secret ways
that nobody else could find and they say
”Sneak!”, “Sneak!” Very nice friends, oh
yes, my Precious, very nice.
SAM
Alright, alright - You just startled
me is all.
(peering over the cliff’s edge)
What were you doing?
SMÉAGOL
(sly)
Sneaking!
Too exhausted to argue, SAM turns away.
SAM
Fine, have it your own way.
SAM gently shakes FRODO’S shoulder.
SAM (cont’d)
Sorry to wake you, Mr. Frodo. We have
to be moving on.

He took it! He must have!
GOLLUM

Sméagol? No, no, not poor Sméagol.
Sméagol hates nasty Elf bread!
SAM
You're a lying wretch! What did you
do with it?
FRODO
He doesn't eat it ... he can't have
taken it.
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM slaps his hand against SAM’S JACKET ... sending
LEMBAS CRUMBS RAINING DOWN!
GOLLUM
What's this? Crumbs on his jacketses!

He took it! He took it! I seen him,
he's always stuffing his face when
Master's not looking!

SAM
Alright, I'm sorry, I didn't mean for it
to go so far. I was angry ... Here, let's
rest up a bit.
SAM attempts to fuss around FRODO...
FRODO
(exhausted)
I'm alright.
SAM
No, no, you're not alright! You're
exhausted. It's that Gollum; it's this
place; it's that thing around your neck.
I could help a bit ... I could carry it
for a while - share the load.

See! See! He wants it for himself.
SAM
(beside himself)
Shut up, you! Go away. Get out of here.
CLOSE ON: FRODO...
FRODO
(quietly)
No, Sam ... it's you.
SAM stares at FRODO with DISBELIEF.
FRODO (cont’d)
I'm sorry, Sam...
CLOSE ON: TEARS WELL in SAM’S eyes...
SAM
(hopelessly)
But ... he's a liar ... he's poisoned
you against me.
FRODO
You can't help me anymore.

You don't mean that.

Faramir! Faramir! Your father's will

FARAMIR

DENETHOR
Can you sing, Master Hobbit?
PIPPIN
(uneasy)
Well ... yes, at least, well enough for my
own people ... but we have no songs for
great halls and evil times ... we seldom
sing of anything more terrible than wind
or rain.
DENETHOR
And why should your songs be unfit for my
halls, or for hours such as these. Come -
sing me a song!
PIPPIN’S simple, clear voice echoes through the VAST HALL.
PIPPIN (V.O.)

ELROND’S eyes fall to the EVENSTAR which hangs around ARAGORN’S
neck...
ELROND (cont’d)
The light of the Evenstar is failing.
As Sauron's power grows, her strength
wanes. Arwen's life is now tied to the
fate of the Ring. The Shadow is upon us,
Aragorn, the end has come.
ARAGORN
It will not be our end, but his.
ELROND
You ride to war, but not to victory.
Sauron's armies march on Minas Tirith -

another force which will attack from
the river...

The GHOSTLY FIGURE on the DIMHOLT ROAD...
ARAGORN looks at ELROND in shock...
ARAGORN
Murderers, traitors - You would call
upon them to fight? They believe in
nothing. They answer to no-one.
ELROND
They will answer to the King of Gondor.
ARAGORN’S eyes fall to a PLAIN BLACK SCABBARD, which ELROND

A LIGHT FLARES ahead of him...
ANGLE ON: A SHORT FIGURE steps out of the SHADOWS ... PIPE in
hand.
GIMLI
Just where do you think you're off to?
ARAGORN looks at GIMLI - GRATEFUL for his COURAGE but determined
to go ALONE.
ARAGORN
Not this time ... This time you must
stay, my friend.
LEGOLAS (O.S.)
Have you learnt nothing of the
stubbornness of Dwarves?
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS as he appears, leading his
HORSE - already SADDLED.

You might as well accept it - we're
going with you, laddie.

the BACK of the PLATEAU ... Past the ANCIENT STANDING STONES
that lead to the NARROW PASS.
EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN and GAMLING watch the RETREATING FIGURES of
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI ... ROHAN SOLDIERS emerge from their
tent, crestfallen to see ARAGORN leave.
ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI disappear into the SHADOWS of the
MOUNTAINS. The ROHAN SOLDIERS murmur among themselves, “What’s
happening?”, “Where’s he going?”
GAMLING
Lord Aragorn!
ROHAN SOLDIER (O.S.)
Why does he leave on the eve of battle?
GAMLING
He leaves because there is no hope.
CLOSE ON: THÉODEN as he moves forward.
THÉODEN
He leaves because he must.
GAMLING
Too few have come. We cannot
defeat the armies of Mordor.
THÉODEN
No, we cannot...
(surveying his frightened Men)
But we will meet them in battle,
nonetheless.
Final Revision - October, 2003 72.
EXT. THÉODEN’S TENT, DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN looks at ÉOWYN who stands as if turned to
stone ... she is looking up at a LIGHTENING SKY ... The QUIET
before the MEN depart for WAR...
THÉODEN
(gentle)
I have left instruction: the people are
to follow your rule in my stead ... take
up my seat in the Golden Hall ... long may
you defend Edoras if the battle goes ill.
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN turns to the KING ... her FACE a BLANK ... She
speaks without emotion.
ÉOWYN
What other duty would you have me
do, My Lord?
THÉODEN moves towards her, taking her hand...
THÉODEN
(quiet)
Duty? ...No, I would have you smile again -
not grieve for those whose time has come.
ÉOWYN slowly lifts her head...
THÉODEN (cont’d)
You shall live to see these days renewed.

No more despair.
EXT. DIMHOLT ROAD - DAY
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI make their way up a GLOOMY
CANYON, shadowed by BLACK FIR TREES. The shadowed ridges of the
DWIMORBERG MOUNTAIN rise BEFORE THEM.
It is a SPOOKY PLACE.
(CONTINUED)
Final Revision - October, 2003 73.
CONTINUED:
GIMLI
What kind of an army would linger
in such a place?
LEGOLAS
One that is cursed ... Long ago the Men of
the Mountain swore an oath to the last King
of Gondor - to come to his aid, to fight,
but when the time came, when Gondor's need
was dire, they fled ... Vanishing into the
darkness of the mountain ... And so Isildur
cursed them - never to rest until they had
fulfilled their pledge.
SILENCE surrounds them, there are no birds, no wind. Only the
OMINOUSLY MUFFLED THUD of their horses’ hooves on the dank FIRNEEDLES.
EXT. DIMHOLT GLEN - DAY
ANGLE ON: Before them, at the ROOT OF THE MOUNTAIN, a SHEER WALL
of ROCK towers...
GIMLI
(terrified whisper)
The very warmth of my blood seems
stolen away.
Within the walls, a creepy DARK DOOR gapes like a mouth of
night. SIGNS and FIGURES are carved above its WIDE ARCH.
LEGOLAS
(translating)
The way is shut. It was made by
those who are dead, and the Dead
keep it. The way is shut.
AT THAT MOMENT: A CHILL WIND seems to rush out of the DOORWAY
... ARAGORN stares into the BLACKNESS, his HAIR BLOWING WILDLY.
The HORSES REAR and ‘BUCK’ in terror, turning and GALLOPING
AWAY.
ARAGORN
Brego!

I do not fear death!
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN WALKING into the BLACKNESS.
LEGOLAS quickly follows ... swallowed by the DARKNESS.
CLOSE ON: GIMLI left ALONE ... He hesitates, struggling with his
FEAR.
GIMLI
Well, this is a thing unheard of ... An
Elf will go underground when a Dwarf
dare not.
(gritting his teeth)
Oh! I'd never hear the end of it!
GIMLI plunges into the TUNNEL behind the OTHERS!
EXT. DUNHARROW ENCAMPMENT - DAWN
MUCH ACTIVITY ... HORNS SOUND ... the ENTIRE CAMP is on the
MOVE ... fires are DOUSED, TENTS pulled down, HORSES saddled.
EXT. DUNHARROW PLATEAU - DAWN
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN strides through the CAMP, ÉOMER at his SIDE.
THÉODEN
We must ride light and swift. It's a long
road ahead ... and man and beast must reach
the end with the strength to fight.
ANGLE ON: MERRY ... preparing a LITTLE PONY with a SADDLE and
SUPPLIES. He is wearing an OVERSIZED HELMET and ROHIRRIM
CLOTHING ... he looks at once NERVOUS and EXCITED.
KING THÉODEN breaks away from a COLUMN and rides up to MERRY.
(CONTINUED)
Final Revision - October, 2003 75.

THÉODEN (cont’d)
(gently)
Little Hobbits do not belong in war,
Master Meriadoc.
MERRY
All my friends have gone to battle.
I would be ashamed to be left behind!
THÉODEN
It's a three-day gallop to Minas Tirith.
None of my Riders can bear you as a burden.
MERRY
But ... I want to fight!
THÉODEN
I will say no more.
KING THÉODEN wheels his HORSE away...
MERRY is bitterly DISAPPOINTED. He stands, head down - a TINY
DEJECTED FIGURE - as the MIGHTY ROHIRRIM on their LARGE HORSES
ride by ... a jangling sea of HELMETS, SHIELDS and BANNERS.
SUDDENLY ... MERRY is plucked off the ground! A SOLDIER has
snatched him by the collar ... and plonked him down on their
SADDLE!
CLOSE ON: MERRY twists around, looking up at the SOLDIER ...
Beneath a HELMET and MAIL HOOD is...
...ÉOWYN, disguised as a MAN!
ÉOWYN
(grimly)
Ride with me.
MERRY
My Lady!

EXCITED!

beating the DRUMS OF WAR ... MINAS TIRITH lies ahead - only TWO
MILES AWAY!
INT. PATHS OF THE DEAD CAVERN - DAY
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN leads LEGOLAS and GIMLI into a WIDE CAVERN ...
he WAVES HIS TORCH through the DARKNESS: ILLUMINATING a HUGE
CAVERN...
A ghastly CREAKING NOISE, like stone being sundered, cuts
through the SILENCE.
A GHOSTLY FIGURE steps from the ROCK WALLS!
ANGLES ON: ARAGORN, LEGOLAS and GIMLI look on in HORROR, as a
MUMMIFIED SPECTRE looms before them: EYELESS SOCKETS ... ROTTEN
TEETH ... a pale SICKLY GLOW ... the KING OF THE DEAD!
FOG SWIRLS around as the GHOST SNARLS at ARAGORN...
KING OF THE DEAD
Who enters my domain?

You will suffer me!
The KING OF THE DEAD’S MALEVOLENT LAUGH echoes through the
CAVES...
ANGLE ON: The FOG suddenly ROLLS BACK, forming a retreating wall
of GREY VAPOR ... slowly, RANK upon RANK of SPECTRAL WARRIORS
are revealed! GHOULISH FACES ... RUSTING WEAPONS ... TATTERED
BANNERS.
WIDE ON: The FOG reveals a DEAD ARMY of MANY THOUSANDS ...
assembled around the CAVERN!

SWORD above ARAGORN’S HEAD!
KING OF THE DEAD
(raspy yell)
None but the King of Gondor may
command me!
QUICK BEAT: ARAGORN RAISES ANDÚRIL...
With a TERRIFYING SHRIEK, THE KING OF THE DEAD SWEEPS his SWORD
towards ARAGORN’S HEAD!
SLOW MOTION: ARAGORN raises his SWORD in ANSWER ... a LOW
WHISTLE as it SWEEPS through the AIR...
CLANG! The BLADE OF ANDÚRIL clashes with the SPECTRAL SWORD ...
the SHARP RING of METAL reverberates through the CAVERNS!
CLOSE ON: THE KING OF THE DEAD stares at ARAGORN in DISBELIEF.
KING OF THE DEAD (cont’d)

It cannot be - that line was broken!

Her LEGS are bent, with a 12-FOOT SPAN and HAIRS that stick out
like steel spines. Her HUGE, SWOLLEN BODY, a vast bloated bag,
sways and sags between her legs. Her age-old BLACK HIDE is
knobbly and pitted, blotchy with LIVID MARKS ... but her belly
underneath is PALE and LUMINOUS.
SHELOB beats the air with her FORELEGS.

SHELOB squats above FRODO, her EYE CLUSTERS fidgeting with
hideous delight, gloating over a prey trapped beyond all hope of
escape.

SPIDER ... hewing off the TIP of a LEG!

slow, sleep of death embalmed. We shall

through her! HEAVING up again, she wrenches herself away from
the PAIN ... her LIMBS writhing beneath her.

RING...
FRODO
Give it to me.
SAM hesitates ... TENSION instantly builds between them.

Sam! Give me the Ring.

and LAVA high into the air, lighting the low cloud blanket of
MORDOR with a flickering ORANGE WASH.
With immense trepidation, FRODO and SAM head down the steep
path into the dark kingdom...
...TWO TINY FIGURES in a bleak, foreboding landscape. Before
them lies the PLAIN OF GORGOROTH ... Their eyes are drawn to
the OMINOUS SILHOUETTE of MOUNT DOOM...
SAM
We did it, Mr. Frodo. We made it to
Mordor.
ANGLE ON: FRODO’S eyes travel down towards the HUNDREDS of FIRES
which glow on the PLAINS beneath them ... thousands upon
thousands of ORCS are encamped there.
FRODO
There are so many of them ... So
many. We’ll never get through unseen.

INT. MINAS TIRITH, TOWER HALL - DAY
CLOSE ON: GANDALF stands in the TOWER HALL ... seemingly
alone ... he speaks quietly, doubt and fear edge his voice.
GANDALF
Frodo has passed beyond my sight.
The darkness is deepening.
He turns and crosses the HALL to reveal the presence of
GIMLI, LEGOLAS, ÉOMER and ARAGORN...
ARAGORN, his back to GANDALF...
ARAGORN
If Sauron had the Ring, we would know it.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF - still troubled, still worried...
GANDALF
It's only a matter of time. He has suffered
a defeat, yes, but behind the walls of
Mordor our enemy is regrouping.
GIMLI sits insolently on the SEAT of the STEWARD...
GIMLI
Let him stay there. Let him rot. Why
should we care?
GANDALF looks across at the DWARF ... His face ashen.
GANDALF
Because ten thousand Orcs now stand
between Frodo and Mount Doom.

ARAGORN
No.
GANDALF looks up sharply at ARAGORN...
ARAGORN (cont’d)
There's still hope for Frodo. He needs
time and safe passage across the Plains
of Gorgoroth. We can give him that.
GANDALF
How?
ARAGORN
Draw out Sauron's armies - empty his lands.
Then we gather our full strength and march
on the Black Gate.
At this, GIMLI CHOKES on his pipe ... ÉOMER steps forward.
ÉOMER
We cannot achieve victory through
strength of arms.
ARAGORN
Not for ourselves ... But we can give
Frodo his chance if we keep Sauron's
eye fixed upon us. Keep him blind to
all else that moves.
LEGOLAS
A diversion...
CLOSE ON: GANDALF speaks in a low tone to ARAGORN...
GANDALF
(doubtful)
Sauron will suspect a trap. He will
not take the bait!

ARAGORN (cont’d)
I see in your eyes the same fear that

we forsake our friends and break all bonds
of fellowship; but it is not this day - an
hour of wolves and shattered shields, when
the Age of Men comes crashing down - but it
is not this day!! This day we fight! By all
