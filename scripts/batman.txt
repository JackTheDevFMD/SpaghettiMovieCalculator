BLACK SCREEN
The quiet hum of CITY TRAFFIC and DISTANT SIRENS.
Gradually, we make out something unnerving, right beside
us: SOMEONE BREATHING ... A MASSIVE RED TITLE FADES UP:
"T H E B A T M A N"
HOLD; then SMASH OUT OF THE BLACKNESS TO REVEAL
AN OUT OF FOCUS BINOCULAR POV - DUSK
We FOCUS, SE ARCHING THE FACADE OF AN OPULENT TOWNHOUSE ...
The BREATHING SUDDENLY QUIETS as a SHAPE APPE ARS IN A
WINDOW -- a LITTLE RED NINJA gazes out, clutching a small
sword. The ninja spins, brandishing the sword as TWO
SHAPES enter behind him -- a WOMAN, late 30s, dressed as
a WITCH -- and a MAN, late 50s, in a WELL-CUT SUIT.
The little ninja rushes in, "stabbing" the Man, who
collapses melodramatically. The Woman smiles -- speaks to
the ninja, and he grabs a PUMPKIN CANDY BUCKET as they
start to exit. The Man sits up, yells after them; the
ninja runs back for a hug. Finally, the ninja and Woman
exit, LEAVING THE MAN ALONE. He grows SOBER. As the Man
pulls himself up, the BREATHING BESIDE US RESUMES ...
INT. OPULENT TOWNHOUSE - DIMLY-LIGHTED STUDY - NIGHT
In the light of the flickering TV, we see now the Man is
handsome, distinguished. He stands, sipping scotch,
watching THE NEWS; a CHYRON reads, "GOTHAM MAYORAL RACE":
FEMALE NEWSCASTER (ON TV)
Just-released polls have incumbent
mayor, Don Mitchell, Jr. and
twenty-eight year ol d grassroots
challenger, Bella Real in a dead
heat. Things certainly got hot
last night in their final debate
before next Tuesday's election ...
As the Man anxiously watches the DEBATE CLIP, we realize:
he is MAYOR MITCHELL; his female challenger, BELLA REAL,
young, intelligent, a force of nature, shares the stage --
MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)
Now my young opponent here wants
to gut the Gotham Renewal Program
established by the great Thomas
Wayne, cutting the funds for vital
projects like our sea wall, and
the safety net for those in need--

BELLA REAL (ON TV)
-- the Renewal Program is broken!
The city's been "renewi ng" for
twenty years, look where it's
gotten us! Crime has skyrocketed!
MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)
Now wait a minute hold
BELLA REAL (ON TV)
Murder and drug use are at
historic highs! We have a
masked vigilante running
the streets!
.Q!!.
MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)
-- under my administration the
Gotham PD dealt major blows
against organized crime and drug
trafficking! The Salvatore Maroni
case was the biggest drug bust in
city history
BELLA REAL ( ON TV)
but drops and other
drugs are still rampant!
It's gotten worse!
MAYOR MITCHELL (ON TV)
I'm not saying there isn't
work to do -- but listen -I
have a beautiful wife and
young son, ok? I will not
rest until this city is
safe for them -- and all
our citizens!
Mitchell turns, startled, as a PHONE RINGS. As he EXITS
FRAME to answer, we STAY on a DARK HALL BEHIND THE STUDY
-- on the wall by the door way, we see a framed headline:
"MARONI DRUG BUST! MAYOR'S STING OPERATION HISTORIC".
As the TV brightens, we SEE for the first time, SOMEONE
IS IN THE HALL. Barely visible, the Figure wears a DARK,
OLIVE GREEN HOOD -- a homemade executioner's mask, with
PRESCRIPTION AVIATOR GLASSES bizarrely outside the hood.
MAYOR MITCHELL (O.S.)
Hey. Yeah, I'm watching GCl ...
As Mitchell PACES IN AND OUT OF FRAME, the Figure's
hooded head ominously tracks him ...
MAYOR MITCHELL (O.S.)
Why is she still tied -- I thought
we were getting a bump in the new
Post poll ... ? Ok, you know what? I
can't, I can't watch this anymore
-- call me in the morning --
We HEAR the phone hang up, and Mitchell RE-ENTERS FRAME,
agitated; as he SHUTS OFF THE TV, the HALL BEHIND HIM
SUDDENLY GOES DARK, the FIGURE NO LONGER IN SIGHT.

Mitchell stand s there, d rink in hand; starts to sip, as -THE
FIGURE LURCHE S OUT THE DARK -- FRANTICALLY CLUBBING
HIM OVER AND OVER -- suddenly, the WEAPON SLIPS LOOSE -it
SKITTERS right at us and STOPS. A GLEAMING METAL TOOL.
Whatever it is, it's WET with bl ood. The Figure turns,
PANTING, rises off the m otionless victim, trudges over to
us ... A GLOVED HAND retrieves the strange weapon.
The Figure walks back, regarding the victim for a l ong,
creepy m oment ... then stretches its arms as far as they
will g o, LOUDLY UNSPOOLING a LONG PIECE OF SILVER DUCT
TAPE ... And with a LOW RUMBLE OF THUNDER, we SLAM INTO --
BLACKNESS AGAIN ...
We HEAR PATTERING RAIN as a HYPNOTIC VOICE OVER begins:

SLOW BOOTSTEPS ECHO from somewhere in the station -Everyone
turns, looking anxiously around -- THE YOUNG
MAN 'S EYES STARE into a DARK VOID beneath an overhang
THE OTHERS LOOK TOO -- AS -- CLICK ... CLICK ... CLICK ...
A MASKED FIGURE SHROUDED IN BLACK APPEARS LIKE AN
APPARITION FROM THE SHADOWS -- STEPPING INTO THE RAIN
IT'S THE BATMAN.
Everyone stares, unnerved. The L eader smirks, sizing up
what he assumes is just another Halloween costume --
THE LEADER
The hell are you supposed to be?
Batman stands there for a long, scary beat, eyes veiled:
THE BATMAN
I'm vengeance.
The unsettling effect of this response has barely an
instant to register before BATMAN stalks for THE LEADER
ONE OF THE GANG MEMBERS
Holy shit -- it's him -- !!!
THE LEADER raises his hands ready to fight -- but totally
unprepared for this fight -- because -- BATMAN'S
MOVEMENTS ARE INCONCEIVABLY BRUTAL AND FAST --

Batman slowly lifts his head, looking for more comers ...
The few remaining on their feet gape -- frozen -- Batman
watches -- a s they BREAK INTO A RUN -- all -- EXCEPT -the
Youngest Gang Mem ber -- who hesitates briefly under
Batman's stone-faced gaze -- in awe -- then, races off ...
Batman looks down to discover the Passenger, knocked to
the ground in the chaos; he RAISES HIS HANDS, terrified --
PASSENGER
... please don't hurt me ...
Batman just gazes strangely, cocking his head, taking a
step slowly toward him -- the Passenger BRACES HIMSELF -as
Batman PEERS DOWN at SOMETHING BESIDE THE PASSENGER'S
HEAD -- a REFLECTION on the wet ground -- THE BAT SIGNAL!
Batman LOOKS UP -- wondering how long it's been there --

He was alive when it was cut off.
Appalled, they turn to Batman, who stares at the hand -BATMAN

the Detective watches him go -- turns back to Gordon:

MUSCLE CAR, both retro and like nothing we've ever seen.
A TV plays GCl; the headline, "MAYOR MITCHELL MURDERED"
below it: "ACTING MAYOR TOMLIN TO RUN IN HIS PLACE"
GCl NEWSCASTER
... this certainly isn't the first
time Gotham has been rocked by the
murder of a political figure. In
fact, in an eerie coincidence it
was twenty years ago this month
that celebrated billionaire
philanthropist, Dr. Tho mas Wayne,
and his wife Martha were slain
during Wayne's own mayoral
campaign in a shocki ng crime that
remains unsolved to this day --
Bruce's eyes go to the TV; when from the FREIGHT ELEVATOR
steps ALFRED, 50s, muscular, waistcoat and shirtsleeves -he
walks on an elegant CANE, SCAR on his face, eyes on
the TV -- seeing him, Bruce resumes work -- Alfred turns
to Bruce -- an unspoken tension; Bruce avoids his gaze --

Yeah.

this continues, it won't be long
before you've nothing left --
BRUCE
I don't care about that. Any of
that.
ALFRED
... you don't care about your
family's legacy?
BRUCE
What I'm doing is my family's
legacy -- and if I can't change
things here, if I can't have an
effect, then I don't care what
happens to me --

Bruce rises -- Alfred watches him go, pained. Then turns
to the computer, seeing THUMBNAILS from the lens footage;
one is THE BOY IN NINJA COSTUME. He clicks it; the boy
looks up, sad. Alfred stares, deeply affected.
Alfred's eyes drift to the PRINTED CIPHER. H is gaze fixes
on words Bruce has written above the eerie symbols in the
Halloween card: "HE LIES STILL" . . .
INT. WAYNE TOWER - GRAND FOYER - MOVING - MORNING
Atop the staircase, we start on a SET OF DOUBLE DOORS
a THICK CHAIN coiled crudely through the handles, a
PADLOCK sealing us off from whatever is beyond -- Bruce
moves past, down stairs, wet hair, pulling on a t-shirt
muscular but underweight like a rock star -- a street
fighter's scars and bruises -- MOVE with him, through the
apartment's hotel-like scale -- and neglect that has left
dirt and disrepair over former grandeur -- he ENTERS - -
THE DINING ROOM
-- to find Alfred at the table, irranersed in what looks
like a crossword -- without looking up, Alfred points --
ALFRED
Some fresh berries there ...
Bruce squints, unaccustomed to morning; grabbing berries,
he pulls out sunglasses -- when he sees Alfred's working
on the CIPHER; Alfred's interest breaks the ice --
BRUCE
... what're you doing?
ALFRED
Just reminiscing about my days in
the Circus. This is actually
quite ... elusive.
BRUCE
Where'd you get the O's?
ALFRED
"He lies still" is only a partial
key. It only gives us H, E, L, I,
and S -- so I'm looking for any
double symbols to start, trying
letters, see where it leads ...
BRUCE
Interesting.

See them in please, D ory ...
THE D INING ROOM - MOMENTS L ATER
TWO YOUNG EXECUTIVES STARE RIGHT AT US --
ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES
I'm afraid we're at a critical
point here
REVEAL BRUCE -- in SUNGLASSES, stone-faced -- his gaze
shifts distractedly to Alfred's newspaper on the table
ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES
At the very least, we'll need your
signature to cover these losses ...
Bruce reaches for the newspaper, opens it -- the execs
glance at each other, thrown; Alfred s miles, apologetic
Bruce stares at the SEA OF LETTERS, wheels turning --
ONE OF THE EXECUTIVES (O.S.)
Mr. Wayne ... ?
BRUCE
(glances blankly up)
... what?
YOUNG EXECUTIVE
I ... I need your signature, sir ...
And as Bruce signs -- we PREL AP:
BRUCE ( V. 0 • )
What if it isn't a partial key ... ?

What i f it's the whole key? Ignore
the symbols we don't have letters
for, use only the letters from "he
lies still", and leave the rest --
ALFRED
-- blank, yes -- I understand
(deleting letters)
-- but that will leave most of the
cipher unsolved ... I don't see how
that -- oh ...
(suddenly impressed)
Well.

They gaze at THE LAPTOP: most of the cipher is now blank,
but the remaining letters line up like connect-the-dots
to form A SINGLE HUGE WORD across the page: "DRI VE"

Gordon looks at an ASTON DBll: one of the tires is flat.
They approach. Batman kneels, pulling a PAIR OF POULTRY
SHEARS out of the tire -- they're COVERED IN DRIED BLOOD.
INSIDE THE DBll
Batman turns on a UV LIGHT BAR searching the console --
GORDON
What're we looking for ?
BATMAN
... USB port
GORDON
-- USB -- ?
Batman stops, struck. Looks at Gordon, who can't see
inside the console -- then looks back --
GORDON

Batman pulls out a KEY RING USB DRIVE -- attached to it,
in a little clear plastic bag, is a SEVERED THUMB ...

BATMAN

GORDON
No idea ... But that's the Penguin
Carmine Falcone's right hand --

WOMAN appears streetwise vibe. She stops, uneasy --
THE PENGUIN
No, no -- it's ok, baby -- Mr.
Vengeance here don't bite ...
She hesitates, eyes on Batman; then saunters to Penguin,
sets down a drink tray; as Penguin touches her thigh, she
slyly brushes his hand away with a smile -- says low
WOMAN IN THE EVE NING GOWN
Touch me again, Oz, I'll break

Look, I'm just a proprietor, ok?
What people do here ain't got
nothin' to do with me.

Batman senses something in the mirror -- he turns -- to
see the Woman in the Evening Gown still watching through

Batman turns back -- Penguin hands him the photo
THE PENGUIN
Whoever she is, she's one hot

Why don't you ask Mitchell's wife?
Maybe she knows.

What? Too soon?
Batman looks at the photo again -- spots an Evening Gown

Ok. .. Ok. .. I'll. .. I'll tell you

As the CAMERA STOPS, SUPER-TIGHT on the wired glass, the
BLURRED PRISONER finally lifts his head ... As he presses
HIS LIPS close to the window -- THEY COME INTO FOCUS -HIS
MOUTH IS DISEASED, HORRIBLY DISTORTED INTO A RICTUS
GRIN -- THE PRISONER IS THE JOKER --
Batman faces the door, waiting for it to unlock -- as the
Joker continues, quiet, sadistic pleasure in his voice --
THE JOKER

about his motives, whether he
loves you or hates you ... I

you're just ... terrified. Because
you're not sure he's wrong ...

CHYRON explains why Batman is so affected -- it's THOMAS
WAYNE. Batman watches, unnerved -- staring at a ghost
THOMAS WAYNE
I believe in Gotham. I believe in
its promise. But too many have
been left behind for too long. And
that's why I'm here today to
announce, not only my candidacy
for mayor, but also the creation
of the Gotham Renewal Fund. Win or
lose, the Wayne Foundation pledges
a one billion dollar donation to
start a charitable endowment for
public works. I want to bypass
political gridlock to get money to
people and projects who need it
llilli -- like these children behind
me. Renewal is about growth. It's
about planting seeds. And renewing
Gotham's promise.

You know, whoever the hell you

He just stares back -- giving nothing away -BATMAN

SELINA
What?
BATMAN
Compromising yourself for money.
She glares at him --
BATMAN
What'd you have to do to set up
that score? How cl ose did you have
to get? To Penguin -- to Falcone?

you're talking about, ok?!

SELINA

Below ... just like Anni. She used
to take me there when I was a
little girl ...
BATMAN
... to the club?
SELINA
... I hid out in the dressing room
while she worked. I used to see
him there ... He scared the shit
out of me. I could never
understand why he looked at me the
way he did. Then one night, my
mother told me ... who he was.
He studies her as she gazes out at the skyline ...
SELINA
When I was seven, my mother was
murdered ... Someone strangled her,
they never found out who, probably
some creep from the club. Anyway,
when Social Services came to take
me away, he didn't say a thing.
Couldn't even look at me.
(looks up at him)
He owes me that money.

He looks at her, taking her in for the first time; nods:
BATMAN
... sorry. For what I said ...
She smiles. Studies his eyes.
SELINA
's alright ... you just assume the
worst in people ... Maybe we aren't
so different after all ...

Listen to me ... if we don't stand
up for Anni, no one will. All
anyone cares about in this place
are these ... white ... privileged
assholes -- the mayor, the
commissioner, the D.A. -- and now
Thomas and Bruce Wayne. Far as I'm
concerned, that psycho's right to
go after these creeps -- I'd think
you'd be on his side !
BATMAN
-- wa it, what do you -- what do
you mean Thomas and Bruce Wayne?
SELINA
What, do you live in a cave? The
Riddler's latest -- it's all about
the Waynes ...
He's silently struck -- but Selina doesn't even notice --
SELINA
Listen -- if I can find that
dickbag Kenzie, will you help me?
He looks at her, reeling -- sees her pleading eyes
SELINA
(quiet, intimate)
Please. . . Come on, "Vengea nce" ...
BATMAN
(finally nods; then)
But don't make any moves without
me -- understa nd -- this is all
more dangerous than you know--
-- she cuts him off with a LONG KISS ... then pulls slowly
back ... staring into his eyes, whispering with a smile --

FALCONE looks over to see Bruce, the Twins behind him -Bruce
glowers silently at Falcone, who stares back with a
smirk ... when the others begin to notice, quieting ...
FALCONE
Give us a minute, fellas.
The BODYGUARDS usher everyone out.
FALCONE
Have a seat ...
But Bruce just stands there.
FALCONE
Thought I might hear from you.
This Riddler sonuvabitch is really
stirring things up, isn't he-- ?
BRUCE
(quiet)
Is it true?
FALCONE
What? ... that reporter business?

BRUCE
The truth. Did you kill him. For
my father.
FALCONE
Look, your father saved my life. I
was loyal to him. I even trieda
give money to his campaign, and
that whole Renewal thing -- but he
wouldn't take it. He didn't wanna
associate with a guy like me
BRUCE
My father hated everything you
stand for.
FALCONE
(smiles)
Yeah, I know. Course he did. Guys
like you, your father, you don't
want anything to do with me ...
(darkens, bitter)
... til you need me. Right?
A beat as they look at each other.
FALCONE
Your father was in trouble, ok?
This reporter had some dirt, some
very personal stuff about your
mother, her family history ... you
know, everybody's got their dirty
laundry, that's how it is. But he
didn't want none of that coming
out, not right before the
election. Your father trieda pay
this guy off, but he wasn't goin'
for it. So he came to me. I never
seen him like that. He said: I
want you to put the fear of God in
this guy.
Bruce stares, unnerved ...
FALCONE
And when fear isn't enough, you
take it to the next level. Your
father wanted me to handle it.
(a shark's eyes)
So I did. I handled it.

like him is capable of. In the
right situation.
(then)
Do me a favor, don't lose any
sleep over this, ok? This reporter
was a lowlife, he was on Maroni's
payroll -- he got what was comin' .
BRUCE
... Maroni?
FALCONE
Oh yeah. Maroni could never stand
your father and I had history. And
after what happened with this
reporter, I think he was worried
your father would be in my pocket
forever. He woulda done anything
to keep him from becoming mayor.
(a pointed beat)
Ya understand?
87.
Bruce shakes his head, reeling, resisting the notion ...
FALCONE
... sure ya do ...
BRUCE
Are you saying ... ? Salvatore
Maroni ... had my father killed?
Falcone lets that just hang in the air ... then:
FALCONE
Do I know it for a fact ... ? I'm
just sayin', it sure looked that
way to me.
As the shock hits Bruce ... Falcone regards him coldly ...
FALCONE
This what you wanted? This little
conversation here?
Bruce can't even respond ...

Bruce arrives at the top of the stairs in a daze, stops,
staring at ... the CHAINED and PADLOCKED SET OF DOORS ...
INT. BRUCE'S PARENTS' DARKENED BEDROOM - MOMENTS LATER
Untouched in twenty years ... a frozen moment, covered in
dust. Bruce enters, taking in the unbearable stillness ...
In the early light, he sees a man's suit jacket draped on
a chair ... a pair of glasses rest on an old newspaper ...
He turns, seeing a STAINED TEACUP, askew in its saucer on
a woman's dressing table ... behind it, on the mirror, are
yellowed CHILDREN'S CRAYON DRAWINGS: his ... One's a stickfigure,
smiling family ... a mother, father, and child .. .
A quiet HEART MONITOR BEEPING begins as Bruce stares .. .
INT. ALFRED 'S HOSPITAL ROOM - TWILIGHT
Alfred opens his eyes to see BRUCE seated at his bedside,
rumpled. Bruces smiles sadly, finally speaking, pained:
BRUCE
... you lied to me. My whole life.
(long, pregnant beat)
I ... spoke to C armine F alcone ...
Pain and shock fill Alfred's eyes ... he blinks away; then
back. Finally, he struggles for voice ... hoarse ...
ALFRED
... what'd he ... say ... ?
BRUCE
... he ... told me what he did ...
for my father ... and about
Salvatore Maroni.
Alfred's eyes burn ... trying to understand ...
ALFRED
... he told you ... Salvatore
Maroni ... ?
BRUCE
... had my father killed.
Alfred just gazes, pained.
BRUCE

I spent all these years fighting
for him ... believing he was a good
man
ALFRED
-- he was a good man
89.
Bruce shakes his head -- but Alfred grows more fierce
ALFRED
-- listen to me ... your father ...
was a good man -- he ... made a
mistake --
BRUCE
A mistake? He had a man killed -why
-- to protect the family image
-- his political aspirations ?
ALFRED
-- it wasn't to protect the family
image -- and he DIDN'T have anyone
killed ...
The forcefulness of that makes Bruce stop -- he looks at
Alfred ... who continues, simply, emotional ...
ALFRED
He was protecting your mother. He
didn't care about his image, the
campaign, any of that. He cared
about her. And you. These ...
... secrets about your mother's
family, they haunted her, she'd
battled them every single day. We
all have our scars, Bruce. And
your father knew, if everything
came out, it'd be too much for
her. It would destroy her. He
just ... he loved her so much. And
in a moment of weakness, he turned
to Falcone. But he never thought
Falcone would kill that man. Your
father should have known that
Falcone would do anything to
finally have something on him he
could 1!.§.g ••• to own him. That's
who Falcone is. And that was your
father's mistake.
(then)
But when Falcone told him what
he'd done, your father was
distraught -- he told Falcone he
was going to the police, that'd
he'd confess everything ...

Alfred looks at him sadly, so wanting to give Bruce the
answer he needs, the answer he's wanted his whole life ...
ALFRED
... I wish I ... knew for􀁔-··
Yes ... maybe ... Or maybe it was
some random thug on the street who
needed money, who got scared and
pulled the trigger too fast ... I f
you don't think I've spent every
day searching for that answer ...
(truly distraught)
It was my job to protect them -do
you understand? I know you
always blamed yourself. You were
only a boy, Bruce. I could see the
fear in your eyes. But I didn't
know how to help. I could teach
you to fight -- but I wasn't
prepared to take care of you. You
needed a father. But all you
had ... was me. I'm sorry ...
Alfred averts his eyes, red with heartbreak and regret.
Bruce stares at him, deeply affected ...
BRUCE
... no, Alfred ... don't be sorry ...
(then, quiet, struck)
God, I ... never thought I'd feel
fear like that again ... I thought
I'd mastered all that. I mean, I'm
not afraid to die ...
His unflinching gaze meets Alfred's, who nods, solemn ...
then, Bruce's eyes shift away again, processing ...
BRUCE
But I realize now, there's
something I never got past ... The
fear of ... ever going through any
of that again ...

BRUCE

Alfred watches Br uce, a fleeting glimpse of the man as a
boy ... He reaches out a hand. Bruce stares, sur prised ...
then lifts his own ... clasping Alfred's tightly ... Then
Br uce darkens ... noticing something outside the window ...
Alfred turns ... sees the BAT SIGNAL IN THE SKY.

they all went after it like
vultures -- the mayor -- Falcone
Maroni -- everyone got in on it
it was perfect -- for makin'
bribes -- laundering money -- a
huge charitable fund with no
oversight -- everybody got a
piece. But Falcone wanted more. So
he orchestrated a play to take
Maroni down big -- he'd rat out
his drops operation, make the
careers of everybody that went
after him, then install them all
as his puppets ... He'd run the
city. And he's been <loin' it ever

GRABS THE GUN -- aiming at Falcone distraught,
filled with fury Batman holds her back -- she ERUPTS:
SELINA
He has to PAY -- !
Batman qently puts his hand on the gun -- as she shakes,
still panting, adrenaline surging -- he says, quietly:
BATMAN
But you shouldn't have to pay with
him ...
She turns to him -- not understanding -- still frenzied -BATMAN
... you've paid enough.
Something in that finally gets through ... she relents .. .
Batman watches as her eyes drift down, lost, reeling .. .

Batman slowly turns, rage now smoldering in his eyes.
FALCONE
Lemme tell you something: whatever
I know, whatever I done, it's all
goin' with me, OK? To my grave.
Batman gazes into his black eyes, restraining himself -then
turns to see -- GORDON waiting with a SHOTGUN at the
open front door -- Falcone smirks as they reach him
FALCONE

but before we see his face -- REVEAL -- the S HOW OF FORCE
AROUND HIM -- THE PLACE IS PACKED
Then, at last, WE SEE HIM FOR THE FIRST TIME -- and his
signature PRESCRIPTION AVIATORS; he's pale, unremarkable;
a NOBODY. A creepy half-smile forms as he stares at the
cops -- like he's been expecting them ... when f inally, he
speaks, gesturing toward the kitchen with the stirrer --
RIDDLER

REVEAL BATMAN -- scanning SCRIBBLED TITLES on the ledgers
he cocks his head to read one, struck: "RENEWAL"
On the other side of the room, Gordon confers with a
FORENSIC COP by a PILE OF YEL LOWING, RATTY NOTEBOOKS
GORDON
-- what are all these -- diaries?
F ORENSIC COP
Ledgers -- he's got thousands
scrawled all over 'em -- ramb lings

A DETECTIVE ON THE PHONE suddenly shouts excitedly
DETECTIVE ON THE PHONE

Hey, lieutenant! You really

Gordon turns -- to see the Surly Cop gesturing beside
Batman who's now reading the Renewal ledger
SURLY COP
What about chain of evidence?
Ignoring him, Batman looks up at Gordon with a foreboding
stare -- Gordon approaches; Batman hands him the ledger
GORDON
(shrugs to Surly Cop)
... he's wearing gloves ...
Gordon gazes at the ledger -- the top sheet is smothered
in WRITING, SCRAWLED right on the columns of numbers -as
GORDON READS -- we SEE Batman stalk the room,

escape. But then today, I SAW
IT ... A SINGLE WORD o n this
ledger, sitting on the desk beside
me! RENEWAL! The empty promise
they sold to me as a child in that

finally I UNDERSTOOD! My whole

As Batman passes CAGES OF AGITAT E D RATS, a SCREECHING
grabs his attention; he moves for it as Gordon goes on
GORDON (O.S.)
"If you want people to understand,
REALLY understand, you can't just
give them the answers. You have to
CONFRONT them, TORTURE THEM with
the horrifying questions -- Just
like they tortured ME. I KNOW NOW
WHAT I MUST BECOME. "
As the SCREECHING ESCALATES, Gordon flips more pages, the
Riddler's scrawl becoming illegible, until it's nothing
but ANGRY SCARS OF INK -- Gordon is shaken by the display
of insanity -- until the intense SCREECHING becomes TOO
MUCH -- he glances up, seeing Batman by the cages --
GORDON
Jesus -- I don't think that rat
likes you, man --
BATMAN
This one's not a rat ...
Gordon and the Surly Cop step closer to see ... inside the
cage is A RABID BAT! It SNARLS, BEARING ITS TEE TH, WINGS
BEATING -- beneath it is an ENVE LOPE: "TO THE BATMAN" -attached
to a strange BLOODY, METAL TOOL --

FORENSIC DETECTIVE SURLY COP
Some kinda 2fY tool is it a chisel -- ?
BATMAN
-- it's a murder weapon. He killed
Mitchell with it.

The edge'll match the floorboard

Batman opens the envelope -- another GREETING CARD says:
"JUST FOR YOU"; inside is SCRAWLED, "MY CONFESSION ... "
G ORDON
"My Confession" ... ? What's he
confessing to? He already told us
he killed Mitchell ...
Batman stares at the card with growing dread -BATMAN
This isn't over ...
AN ALARMED VOICE (O .S.)
Oh man -- he's been posting all
kinds of shit online! He's got
like five hund red followers
real fringe types ...
They turn to a DIGITAL FORENSICS COP on Riddler's laptop
-- Gordon moves to see -- but Batman's eyes go to the
wall above ... to AN ENORMOUS COLLAGE -- a sea of DEFACED
PHOTOS -- sc rawled over it: " THE TRUTH ABOUT GOTHAM".
Batman steps forward, gazing at IMAGES of city officials,
police officers, Riddler's victims -- but most prominent
is an image of YOUNG BRUCE WAYNE beside his father at the
Orphanage c e remony -- their EYES ETCHED ANGRILY OUT.
In the B O Y'S CHOIR beside them, a QUESTION MARK encircles
the head of a SAD, SCRAWNY BOY IN AVIATOR GLA SSES who
stares at the Waynes in awe -- next to him are the words:
"If only I knew then . .. what I KNOW now .. . " --
-- Batman sees A CLUSTER OF BATMAN TABLOID HEADLIN ES in
the collage -- among them, a CRUDE POLICE SKETCH,
entitled: "GOTHAM TERRORIZED -- WHO IS THE BATMAN?" Next

The Batman.
Gordon looks confused, when his phone RINGS. He steps
away. Batman watches as Gordon speaks low -- his eyes
suddenly lift darkly to Batman's. He hangs up, unnerved
GORDON

His smile fades. He looks into Batman's eyes; ominously:
RIDDLER
Bruce Wayne ...
Batman's jaw clenches, betraying nothinq -- Riddler's
emotion rises, he looks at the floor, stewing with rage:
RIDDLER
Bruce. Waaaayne.
Batman on edge -- his eyes flit anxiously to a SECURITY
CAMERA recording -- when Ridd ler's eyes snap back to his.
The pause between them is excruciating. Then, bitterly:
RIDDLER
You know, I was there that day ...
the day the great Thomas Wayne
announced he was running for
mayor. Made all those promises ...
Week later he was dead, and
everybody just forgot about us.
All they could talk about was poor
Bruce Wayne ... Bruce Wayne the
orphan ... Orphan? Living in some
tower over the park isn' t being an
orphan. Looking down at everyone
with all that money -- don't you
tell me ... Y ou know what being an
orphan is? Thirty kids to a room,
twelve year s old and already a
drophead, numbing the pain -- you
wake up screaming with rats
chewing your fingers, and every
winter one of the babies dies
because it's so cold. But oh, no.
Let's focus on the billionaire
with the lying dead daddy. Because
at least the money makes it go

But we got the rest of them,

Batman REELS -- Riddler DOESN'T know -- when, Riddler
suddenly softens, his tone turning almost vulnerable:

is amazing. I wish you could have
seen me in mine ...
(an intimate grin)
Isn't it funny? All e veryone wan t s
to do is unmask you, but they're
missing the point ... You and I
both know: I'm looking at the real

THE TOOL IS THE MISSING PIECE. Batman picks it up,
stunned. Looks around frantically, finally spotting ... 􀂀

Why ... you asking me to stay?
But Batman says nothing. She darkens, worry in her voice:

grab -- it'll be bloody

She nods a sad smile, starts her bike, heading off.
Batman watches her go, mounting his; he revs the engine,
accelerating after her -- and for a moment, they chase
through the cemetery, echoes of their motorcycle scene
