D1-5 9.15.09
HANDHELD VIDEO IMAGE
of a gold watch on a wrist and distinctive ring made
from a gold coin on a finger.
The image, shot by someone in the driver’s seat of a
parked car, moves up to the face of the man wearing the
watch and ring - Frank Sheeran.
He’s about 80. Sitting in the passenger seat. A
couple of aluminum canes lean next to him.
VOICE
That’s the house? You sure?
Frank nods but that’s it. The video camera zooms past
him, frames a shot of a wood-shingled house, then pulls
back out and refocuses on him.
VOICE
It’s a very quiet street.
Nothing from Frank.
VOICE
Let’s go have a look.
FRANK
I’m not getting out of the car.
I brought you here, that’s enough.
VOICE
We got to go into the house,
Frank. We come all this way.
Frank looks directly at the video camera for the first
time - and it’s a look so quietly menacing, even with his
eyes behind aviator sunglasses - that the camera recoils
slightly.
VOICE
All right. Fine. Stay in the
car.
The video image jostles as the guy with it gets out on
the driver’s side, widens to show the quiet street, then
focuses on the house again. We notice now there’s
another car in the driveway and a realty sign.
In the car, looking down again, Frank listens the guy’s
footsteps on the porch, a knock on the door of the house,
the door opening, and the door closing again. Only then
does he look up at it.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 2.
INT. MOTEL - LATER - NIGHT
Handheld video image of Frank again - wider this time
- turned half away from the camera in a motel room. He
seems very disturbed.
VOICE
Frank.
FRANK
I took you there. What do you
want now?
VOICE
It’s not what I want. It’s what
you want.
FRANK
What do I want?
VOICE
You know what you want.
FRANK
I do?
VOICE
You want to say you stand by what
you told me.
FRANK
I told you I did.
VOICE
I didn’t have the camera.
Frank turns in his chair and looks at the camera ...
FRANK
You want me to say ...
VOICE
“I stand by what I told you.”
FRANK
To the camera.
VOICE
Yeah.
Frank keeps looking at the camera, but doesn’t say
anything.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 3.
VOICE
Frank, you want to do this.
FRANK
How do you know what I want?
VOICE
You’re telling me it’s not what
you want?
Frank just keeps looking at the camera without saying
anything. Finally -
FRANK
I’m tired. I want to go to bed.
The camera keeps shooting him looking at it.
FRANK
Shut it off.
The video image stays focused on him a moment more, then
snaps to black.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - LATER - NIGHT
Frank is alone in the motel room now. Sitting at the
desk in his pajamas. He has the video camera on it and
is looking at a playback of what the guy shot when Frank
stayed in the car -
THE VIDEO: A slow pan of a dark living room with no
furniture in it. Light spills in as someone opens a
blind. The camera finds a guy by the windows as he
opens another one.
REALTOR
That’s better, huh?
VOICE
That’s fine. Thanks.
THE VIDEO POV walks to the entry. Pans to a short
hallway leading to a kitchen doorway. Turns completely
around and looks at the closed front door. Then - for
some reason - tilts down to take a look at the floor ...
FRANK V/O
It’s usually a friend ... usually
he’s given no choice in the matter
... usually he doesn’t even know
why he’s doing it ...
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 4.
EXT. STREET - DAY
A friend talks to a friend on a street corner.
FRANK V/O
He walks up to you and gives
you a tip on a race or a football
game.
EXT. ANOTHER STREET - DAY
Another friend climbs out of a car to allow a friend the
more desirable front passenger seat.
FRANK V/O
Or tells you to sit in front,
with the better view, he’ll take
the back seat.
INT. KITCHEN - DAY
Another friend sits at a kitchenette table while his
balding friend cooks at a stove.
FRANK V/O
Giancana got it frying eggs and
sausages in olive oil for an old
friend.
CLOSE ON the eggs and sausages crackling in olive oil.
FRANK V/O
The idea is they shouldn’t
know what hit them. You don’t
want them to have that moment of
panic where they realize what it
is -
TWO QUICK SHOTS to the back of the heads of the friend on
the street corner, the one in the car, and the one in the
kitchen. As GIANCANA slams into the stove, upending the
frying pan, and falls to the floor - to BLACK.
FRANK V/O
- because they’re your friend.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - MORNING - 1975
A wedding invitation sits on a bureau next to Frank’s
gold watch.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 5.
FRANK V/O
In this particular matter, the
whole thing was built around the
wedding.
Frank puts the watch on his wrist. The gold ring is on
his finger next to his wedding band. He begins packing a
garment bag. He’s much younger than when we last saw
him. About 55.
FRANK V/O
Bill Bufalino’s daughter was
getting married in Detroit. Bill
was a Teamster lawyer, which meant
he was a mob lawyer, which meant
everyone from Downtown would be
there.
EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE - MORNING - 1975
Frank arranges luggage in the trunk of his Cadillac,
leaving a space for more.
FRANK V/O
Russell didn’t want to fly. He
wanted take care of some business
along the way. Business - in
Russell’s case - means one thing -
collecting money. So we’d drive.
Him and his wife Carrie and me and
Irene.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - MORNING - 1975
While Frank’s wife Irene talks on the kitchen phone to
Russell’s wife Carrie about what to wear, Frank draws a
line on a AAA map.
FRANK V/O
We’d take Highway 76 to 476 to
Allentown - up to Wilkes-Barre -
then west on 80 through the rest
of Pennsylvania - across Ohio to
Toledo - then north on 75 to
Detroit.
EXT. BUFALINO’S HOUSE - DAY
Irene and Carrie smoke cigarettes on the sidewalk while
Frank and Russell Bufalino add his and his wife’s luggage
to the trunk. Russell’s about 15 years older than Frank.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 6.
FRANK V/O
It would take two days with
the business stops and all the
cigarette breaks we’d have to make
for our wives, since Russell
didn’t allow smoking in the car
since that bet with Jimmy Blue
Eyes on Lansky’s boat they took
out of Cuba when Castro kicked
them out and took their casinos.
EXT. OCEAN - DAY
A pack of cigarettes floats on the water. In the
distance, a cabin cruiser motors away.
FRANK V/O
Russell threw his cigarettes
overboard and hasn’t smoked since.
So Jimmy Blue lost 25 grand on
that.
INT. FRANK’S CADILLAC - PHILADELPHIA - DAY - 1975
Frank drives along a city street with Russell in front
and the women in back.
FRANK V/O
But Russell and Lansky and
Giancana and Trafficante lost
about a million dollars a day on
account of Castro, so maybe it was
the memory of that, more than the
smoke in the car, that irritated
him.
CARRIE
Can we stop soon?
BUFALINO
We’re not even on the highway for
Christ’s sake.
CARRIE
You won’t stop on the highway.
EXT. PHILADELPHIA - DAY - 1975
The women smoke outside the car again. Russell
considers the AAA map Frank marked up, Frank watches
some kids in parochial uniforms play soccer on a
Catholic school yard.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 7.
FRANK V/O
We didn’t have soccer growing up.
All we had to amuse ourselves was
fight. Which I guess was good for
us, since when our country needed
soldiers, we were ready.
EXT. ANZIO, ITALY - DAWN - 1943
American soldiers on a beach dig at the sand like sand
crabs as mortars explode around them.
FRANK V/O
One thing I can say for sure is
a beach is not a place you want to
be pinned down. Sunbathing on a
towel, okay.
As Frank, 22, shovels at the sand, soldiers on both sides
of him fall dead from rifle and mortar fire.
FRANK V/O
An exploding shell spreads its
shrapnel in an upward angle. If
you can get down low, it flies
over you, so this is what I
recommend.
Frank jumps into the hole he’s made. Another soldier
clambers out of a hole to grab his rifle.
FRANK V/O
If you don’t get down low, it cuts
you in half.
A blast hits the soldier reaching for the rifle and
separates him at the waist.
EXT. ANZIO - NIGHT
It’s raining, and the beach looks empty - until we begin
to descend beneath the surface level of the sand.
FRANK V/O
A normal foxhole wouldn’t protect
you at Anzio. You had to dig
deeper.
We follow a ladder that leads us deep into a large
foxhole buttressed with planks like in a mine. Still,
the rain is causing mud cave-ins and suffocations.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 8.
EXT. ANZIO - DAY
Frank pees into a helmet in the foxhole.
FRANK V/O
If you left the hole in daylight,
snipers would pick you off. Where
did you think you’d go anyway?
He climbs a ladder just high enough to slosh the pee onto
the beach.
FRANK V/O
You ate out of cans. You played
cards. You prayed. You promised
to sin no more.
EXT. ANZIO - NIGHT
An ominous deep-throated, unrecognizable sound.
FRANK V/O
At night you got shelled by a
piece of artillery the Germans
kept camouflaged during the day.
A shadowy hulk of machinery glides in the dark.
FRANK V/O
They’d move it around on railroad
tracks after dark, when our planes
were on the ground.
Frank listens to the cannon’s roar from his foxhole.
FRANK V/O
We called it the Anzio Express.
It sounded like a freight train in
the night sky and you knew when it
hit there’d be nothing left to
send back home of the guys it
landed on.
The shell hits some men in one of the other foxholes,
killing and burying them all at once.
EXT. ANZIO - DAY
A long row of dead soldiers in a trench. Some arriving
fresh-faced recruits are all but ignored by the
‘veterans’ like Frank.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 9.
FRANK V/O
We watched replacements march
in and be carried out, sometimes
on the same day.
One of the new replacements lifts his head from the
trench only to have it shot off.
FRANK V/O
It was like they found the
bullets rather than the other
way around.
EXT. ANZIO - DAY
As Frank and his friends play cards in the trench, the
new guys sit apart from them.
FRANK V/O
They had to wonder why no one
talked to them. You didn’t talk
to them because you knew they’d be
dead soon and it would be easier
if you didn’t know their names.
EXT. ANZIO - DAY
Frank eats out of a can in the trench.
FRANK V/O
We couldn’t advance. All we
could do was hold the position.
6,000 of us died doing that.
Suddenly the German position is being hit from behind.
Frank ventures up the ladder to cautiously peer over the
lip of the foxhole.
FRANK V/O
But then the main force finally
broke through on the other side
and we were able to climb out of
our holes.
EXT. ANZIO - DAY
Frank and his foxhole survivors have rounded up the
surviving German soldiers.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 10.
(MORE)
FRANK V/O
After 411 days of combat - 122 of
them at Anzio - you could say we’d
had enough. Here these Germans
are shooting at you, trying to
kill you, and now they want to
surrender. Some guys took this
personally.
Frank and a few other guys are going around executing
German prisoners.
FRANK V/O
So maybe you didn’t understand
what they were trying to say.
Frank shoots a German begging for mercy in English.
FRANK V/O
Or maybe they tried to escape.
Frank shoots a German who is not trying to escape.
FRANK V/O
I don’t mean a massacre. I’m
talking about a handful. A couple
handfuls.
Frank hands a German prisoner a shovel and motions for
him to dig.
FRANK V/O
Our lieutenant said it made more
sense for them to dig than us, but
I didn’t think they would.
But they do - a line of German prisoners digging like
Frank did on the beach.
FRANK V/O
You wonder why anyone would dig
their own grave. What’s someone
going to do if you refuse, shoot
you?
Frank watches as his German keeps digging.
FRANK V/O
I guess you cling to some hope
that maybe the guy with the gun
will change his mind by the time
you’re done. Or maybe you’re
happy for the few extra minutes of
life.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 11.
Or maybe you thFiRnAkN Ki fV /yOo(uC ONT'D)
cooperate, you’ll get a nice clean
shot with less pain. I don’t
know.
Frank’s prisoner finishes digging his grave, and Frank
shoots him. As he falls into the hole he dug, the Doris
Day song “Que Sera Sera” begins and carries over -
EXT. ITALY - DAY
As the Americans come through a small Italian town
looking like something out of hell, Frank notices some
of the people taking down little German flags and
putting up little American ones.
The song continues over -
INT. BOARDING HOUSE - PHILLY - NIGHT - 1946
Frank lies on a bed, staring up at the ceiling of a
cheap boarding house room.
FRANK V/O
The Army gave you a hundred
dollars a month for three months.
This seemed like a lot of money to
me, but it isn’t. It runs out,
and then you’re on your own.
INT. BLOOD BANK - PHILLY - DAY
Frank sells his blood for $10 a pint. The song
continues over -
INT. WAGNER’S DANCE HALL - NIGHT - 1947
A fight breaks out between two guys. Frank and another
bouncer throw them out. Coming back in, he notices a shy
girl sitting along the wall. She notices him but looks
away.
FRANK V/O
They say good girls like bad boys.
INT. MOTHER OF SORROWS CHURCH - DAY
Frank and the shy girl are getting married. Her father
doesn’t look happy.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 12.
FRANK V/O
My first wife Mary loved me, but
her family hated me. They thought
I was what they used to call
shanty Irish, and that they were
what they used to call lacecurtain
Irish.
INT. MARY’S PARENTS’ HOUSE - PHILLY - DAY - 1948
Mary’s father looks even less happy here as they eat
dinner in silence. An infant girl sits in a highchair.
FRANK V/O
We didn’t have any money so we
moved in with them. I wouldn’t
advise this if you can help it.
“Que Sera Sera” ends.
EXT. SWIFT’S MEAT COMPANY - PHILLY - DAY - 1949
Frank and some others lug hindquarters across a loading
dock and hang them in a refrigerated truck. Frank comes
back out, and the yard manager closes the truck’s doors,
slaps an aluminum seal on the lock, and has the driver
sign a paper on his clipboard.
Frank watches. When the yard manager heads back to his
office, Frank goes over to the driver.
FRANK
How you get to be a driver?
JOEY
Apply at the Local. If the
roster’s full, they put you on a
list.
FRANK
(in Italian)
Okay to say I’m a friend of yours?
Joey can tell just by looking Frank isn’t Italian, but
his accent isn’t bad. Joey likes that.
JOEY
Where you learn to speak Italian?
FRANK
Italy.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 13.
INT/EXT. FRANK’S CADILLAC / HIGHWAY - DAY - 1975
Irene Sheeran, in back with Carrie Bufalino, puts some
lipstick on. They have finally made it out of Philly and
onto Highway 276. As Frank drives, he regards the
countryside. It’s summer. Lush and beautiful.
IRENE
Can we stop soon?
Russell looks at Frank and sighs.
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY - 1975
Irene and Carrie smoke outside the car while Frank fills
the tank. Russell buys some gum and candy and comes back
out to where Frank is.
BUFALINO
Look where we are.
FRANK
I know.
They regard the unremarkable surroundings like they
weren’t so unremarkable. A tractor-trailer roars past
and -
INT/EXT. HIGHWAY 476 - DAY - 1950’S
Frank drives a truck along 476, the same highway he’ll
drive to Detroit on 25 years later with Russell and their
wives. The engine starts making noises it shouldn’t -
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY - 1950’S
The same gas station. Frank has the truck’s hood open
and stares in at the misfiring engine. Russell appears
out of nowhere with some tools.
BUFALINO
What’s the problem?
FRANK
I don’t know. Something.
Russell listens to it.
BUFALINO
It’s the carburetor.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 14.
He selects a No. 7 wrench from his tools and begins
making adjustments.
BUFALINO
A carburetor only does one thing,
so there’s not much to it.
In a few moments the engine is sounding normal again.
BUFALINO
There you go.
He wipes his hands on a rag, shakes Frank’s hand, and
heads off with his tools.
FRANK
What do I owe you?
Russell waves back, ‘nothing,’ and puts the tools in
the trunk of his car. Frank watches after him as the
car drives off.
FRANK V/O
I thought maybe he owned the
place. He owned something. You
could tell. It turns out he owned
the whole road.
EXT. SOUTH PHILLY - NIGHT - 1950’S
A place called The Friendly Lounge according to its sign.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - NIGHT
Frank hangs out with Joey and some other drivers, all
Italians except him. Across the room at another table
sits a group of low-level mob guys.
JOEY
You should meet Skinny.
Frank and Joey get up and head for the other table -
FRANK V/O
Skinny Razor owned the Friendly
Lounge. He also pushed a little
money. Loans. Book. Lotteries.
Nothing big.
Joey introduces Frank to Skinny Razor, who shakes Frank’s
hand and makes room for him and Joey at his table.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 15.
FRANK V/O
He got the name working at a
butcher shop in South Philly -
INT. BUTCHER SHOP - DAY
A place that specializes in chicken so fresh it’s still
alive. A younger, skinnier Skinny waits on a customer.
FRANK V/O
The Italian ladies would come
in, pick the chicken they wanted
by looking at them in the cages,
and Skinny would take out a
straight razor and cut the
chickens’ throats.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - CONTINUED
But now, Skinny is eating steak at his table.
FRANK
You like steak?
SKINNY
I do. More than chicken.
FRANK
I deliver steak.
SKINNY
Do you.
FRANK
I could deliver you steak.
SKINNY
Could you.
EXT. MEAT COMPANY - DAY
As loading dock workers carry hindquarters like Frank
used to and hang them in his refrigerated truck, he signs
for the load. It’s summer.
FRANK V/O
After your truck is loaded, the
yard manager puts an aluminum seal
on the lock and off you go.
The yard manager slaps the seal on the lock.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 16.
EXT. FOOD FAIR MARKET - DAY
Frank backs up to the store’s loading dock, climbs out
and joins another manager with a clipboard.
FRANK V/O
When you get to where you’re
going, the manager there breaks
the seal and the meat is put in
the refrigerators.
The manager breaks the seal and workers unload the
hindquarters.
FRANK V/O
Once the seal is broken, there’s
no way to put it back on, so don’t
even think about that.
EXT/INT. MEAT COMPANY - DAY
The same loading dock as before, but now there’s snow on
the ground.
FRANK V/O
But when winter comes, the yard
manager isn’t so anxious to leave
the comfort of his office.
A heater glows in the yard manager’s office as Frank
signs for 25 hindquarters.
FRANK V/O
So your offer to put the seal
on the lock for him sounds pretty
good to him.
The yard manager hands Frank the seal. He crosses the
freezing cold dock with it. Shuts the doors of the truck
and reaches for the lock, but palms the seal instead.
FRANK V/O
Now you can deliver, say, five
of your twenty-five hindquarters
to someone else.
EXT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - DAY
As Skinny’s guys carry hindquarters into the back of the
Friendly Lounge, he pays Frank some cash, and Frank puts
the seal on the lock.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 17.
FRANK V/O
Of course, you’re five hindquarters
short now. But it’s
just as cold where you’re going
as where you’ve been.
EXT/INT. FOOD FAIR MARKET - DAY
The store manager rubs his gloves together and breaks the
seal on the lock.
FRANK V/O
So your offer to help the guys
there sounds pretty good to them,
too.
Frank helps the dock guys carry the last of the twenty
hindquarters to the store’s refrigerators. They leave
but he stays behind.
FRANK V/O
Now you take five hindquarters
from the left rail and hang them
on the right rail with the new
delivery.
Back on the dock, the store manager signs for the
shipment - 25 hindquarters - and Frank hops back into
his truck.
FRANK V/O
Of course at Inventory they’ll
see the shortage, but anyone could
have taken them, they got no proof
it was you.
INT. MEAT COMPANY - DAY
The manager warms his hands over his glowing heater.
FRANK V/O
And the yard manager is never
going to admit he was too lazy to
go out in the cold and do his job
in the first place.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - NIGHT
Skinny Razor and his mob friends enjoy a delicious,
and very inexpensive, steak dinner, courtesy of Frank.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 18.
FRANK V/O
But I got carried away one day.
EXT. FOOD FAIR MARKET - DAY
The store manager breaks the seal. The truck doors open
revealing no hindquarters inside. Frank looks mystified.
FRANK
What the fuck?
MANAGER
What the fuck is this?
FRANK
I don’t know. Maybe the guys
forgot to load it.
Everyone on the dock looks at Frank.
MANAGER
You didn’t notice you were driving
a light truck?
FRANK
I didn’t.
EXT. LOCAL 107 - PHILADELPHIA - DAY
The familiar two-horses-and-a-wheel International
Brotherhood of Teamsters logo on the door of the Local.
INT. LOCAL 107 - DAY
Frank sits with a young Teamster lawyer, Bill Bufalino,
whose daughter’s wedding Frank will drive across three
states to attend 25 years later.
BILL
Ever show up late?
FRANK
No.
BILL
Any moving violations?
FRANK
No.
BILL
You drink on the job?
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 19.
(MORE)
FRANK
No.
BILL
Ever hit anyone?
FRANK
On the job?
BILL
Yeah.
FRANK
No.
All this seems to be satisfactory to the lawyer.
BILL
Frank, I don’t care if you did it
or not. It makes no difference to
me. I’m here to defend you. But
did you?
Frank isn’t sure if he’s supposed to admit it or not.
Eventually -
FRANK
I work hard for them when I’m not
stealing from them.
Bill smiles. He likes Frank. He won’t be the last to
appreciate his honest dishonesty.
BILL
Well, they have to prove it first.
If they can, what they’re going to
want is names. Would you give
them names to keep your job?
INT. COURTROOM - DAY
Skinny Razor is among the spectators in the courtroom.
The same Teamster attorney stands before the judge.
BILL
Your Honor, if this were about
right and wrong, the company would
have sought Mr. Sheeran’s
dismissal. They didn’t. What
they sought - and offered him
money in exchange for - were the
names of conspirators he couldn’t
give them. He couldn’t give them
because they don’t exist.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 20.
They don’t exisBtI LbLe(cCaOuNsTe' Dh)e never
stole anything. He never stole
anything because he’s an exemplary
employee who has never taken a day
of sick leave. The only rule he
ever broke was his own union’s, by
helping others carry sides of beef
from his truck to their
refrigerators in the dead of
winter.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - NIGHT
As Frank walks in, Skinny and the guys give him the
hero’s welcome he didn’t get when he returned from the
war.
FRANK V/O
The judge threw the case out.
He said if he owned stock in that
company, he’d sell it.
Skinny and the mob guys toast Frank.
FRANK V/O
The more important thing was I
ratted out nobody. Not even my
lazy yard manager. This meant
everything to Skinny and his
friends.
Skinny introduces Frank to Angelo Bruno, a higher mob
guy.
BRUNO
That was a good thing you did,
Frank. Everybody’s proud of you.
Sit down with me.
Frank sits. As Bruno pours him a glass of wine -
FRANK V/O
Angelo Bruno was Skinny’s boss
and the boss of all Philadelphia,
and a silent partner is just about
everything Downtown, including the
Villa d’Roma -
EXT. VILLA D’ROMA - NIGHT
A restaurant on Ninth Street downtown.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 21.
FRANK V/O
- which is where I was properly
introduced to his boss - the old
guy who helped me with my
carburetor that day on Highway 476
- Russell Bufalino.
INT. FRANK’S CADILLAC - MOVING - DAY - 1975
Russell naps in the passenger seat while Frank drives.
CARRIE
Can we stop, Frank? An hour’s up.
EXT. RURAL PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - 1975
Frank pulls the car over. The women get out to smoke.
The car doors shutting wakes Russell up.
BUFALINO
Where are we?
FRANK
Outside Wilkes-Barre.
BUFALINO
I got some things to do in Wilkes-
Barre. Wake me when we get there.
Russell closes his eyes again to nap.
FRANK V/O
I had no idea how big Russell
was when I met him. His territory
included Pennsylvania, upstate New
York, parts of New York City,
northern New Jersey and Ohio, and
interests in Florida, Canada, and
Havana before Castro threw him
out.
Frank regards his wife and Carrie smoking outside the
car, framed by the windshield.
FRANK V/O
Not only that, his wife Carolina
was related to the Sciandras of
the Cosa Nostra, which meant her
family went back to the earliest
days of the mob, which was like
she came over on the Mayflower.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 22.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - NIGHT - 1950’S
Russell - 20-some-years younger - sits at a table with
one of Frank’s steaks on his plate.
FRANK V/O
Anything that concerned anything,
you had to go to Russell. And you
had to go to where he was because
he never came to you. You either
went to Villa D’Roma - or Vesuvius
- or his curtain shop in Pittston.
INT. CURTAIN SHOP - PITTSTON, PA. - DAY - 1950’S
A succession of guys sits down with Russell in the back
of his shop amidst bolts of fabric.
FRANK
You wanted to bribe a judge, you
asked Russell. You weren’t sure
how much to give him, Russell
would tell you. You wanted to up
one of your guys, he’d tell you if
you should. You wanted to get rid
someone - you needed Russell’s
permission.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - NIGHT - 1950’S - CONTINUED
Russell takes a bite of steak.
BUFALINO
I knew you were okay that day on
the highway. I could tell.
The angle shifts to show Frank sitting at his table.
BUFALINO
You did the right thing, my Irish
friend. Those guys have wives and
kids and you saved them from jail.
Russell pulls back the folds of a napkin in a bread
basket with the care of a man inspecting a bird’s nest.
BUFALINO
Taste this bread. The only
place you can get it this good is
Philly. Whenever I’m here, I
take some home with me. It’s got
prosciutto baked into it.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 23.
Frank tastes a small bite. Russell waits for his
reaction.
FRANK
E buono, grazie.
BUFALINO
E buono, dice. Dove fa un Paddy
impari l’italiano?
FRANK
L’Italia. Nella guerra.
Russell is pleased and impressed with Frank’s Italian
and the fact he was in the war. Regarding the prosciutto
bread -
BUFALINO
Allora. Guardilo. Here’s
the secret. This is what you do.
He takes a piece and dips it in his wine.
FRANK V/O
When you go to confession -
which I used to do more than I do
now - you know which priest’s line
to get on. You want the fairest
one who won’t give you a hard
time. Russell was that priest.
Frank follows Russell’s example and dips his bread in the
wine.
BUFALINO
But Frank. Always remember.
Never eat alone. You might choke.
Frank isn’t sure he understands.
BUFALINO
Whatever it is, you let everyone
in the chain make a decent profit.
You buy a thing for a thousand,
you don’t sell it for two thousand
- you sell it for fifteen hundred
and let the next guy sell it for
two.
FRANK
I understand.
BUFALINO
I know you do. Let’s eat.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 24.
They eat the wine-soaked bread.
INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY - 1999
Frank rides in the passenger seat of the same car
from the opening scene, traveling north to south on
the highway. As it passes a motel -
EXT. MOTEL - WILKES-BARRE - DAY - 1975
Traveling south to north, Frank pulls the Cadillac off
the highway where the same motel sits.
INT. MOTEL LOBBY - WILKES-BARRE - DAY
Frank and Russell check in while their wives smoke
outside.
FRANK V/O
I quit my job - but kept my
union card - and started doing a
little business for Skinny and his
friends, who all worked for
Angelo, which meant they all
worked for Russell.
EXT. HOUSE - PHILLY - DAY - 1950’S
Frank sits in an idling car, the tailpipe breathing steam
into the chilly air.
FRANK V/O
Business - as I said before -
whether you were Skinny, Angelo,
Russell, or anyone else Downtown -
always meant collecting money.
Skinny hurries down the steps of his house in a robe and
slippers, small paper bag in his hand.
FRANK V/O
That’s what they did. They
collected money.
Skinny hands the bag to Frank in the car.
SKINNY
Don’t use it. Just show it to
him.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 25.
Frank sets the bag on the seat. Skinny scampers back up
the steps of his house. Frank drives off.
INT. FRANK’S CAR - LATER - DAY
Frank sits in his car, watching a street corner. Sees a
guy come around it, takes a gun out of the bag, gets out
of the car and intercepts the guy on the sidewalk.
FRANK V/O
In those days, you took a gun
with you to show a guy. These
days, they shoot you with it.
The guy is terrified by the mere sight of the gun and
goes with Frank back to the car without argument.
INT. FRANK’S CAR - MOVING - DAY
Frank notices that the guy has peed in his pants. He
rolls down a window.
FRANK V/O
In those days, you wanted your
money tomorrow. These days, they
want it yesterday.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - LATER - DAY
Skinny regards the guy standing before him in wet pants.
SKINNY
Tomorrow.
DEADBEAT
Tomorrow. I swear.
SKINNY
Here.
DEADBEAT
Here. Tomorrow.
Skinny nods, Okay, go. But the guy doesn’t go.
SKINNY
What.
DEADBEAT
How am I going to get home?
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 26.
SKINNY
Take a fuckin bus, get out of
here.
The deadbeat leaves.
FRANK
He peed in my car.
SKINNY
I always make sure they pee before
they get in the car. I should’ve
told you that.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - NIGHT
Frank, his wife Mary and their two daughters eat dinner
with Russell and Carrie Bufalino.
FRANK V/O
The more I got to know, the more I
knew Russell didn’t come to Philly
only for the prosciutto bread.
Russell tries to show Frank’s daughter Peggy how you eat
prosciutto bread dipped in wine.
FRANK V/O
He and Angelo were involved in
every type of crime known to man:
Loansharking, gambling, hijacking,
prostitution, drugs and murder.
And Peggy somehow senses this. Russell makes her
uncomfortable. She shakes her head no; she doesn’t want
any bread dipped in wine.
FRANK V/O
Everyone including the FBI knew
this, but there wasn’t much they
could do about it, unless someone
talked. And if someone talked -
they didn’t talk much.
FLASHCUT to a parked car’s interior lighting up with
gunfire.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - EVENING
Frank comes in to find Mary cooking and his daughter
Peggy sulking.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 27.
FRANK
What’s the matter with her?
MARY
The grocer slapped her for eating
a grape.
It’s no big deal to Mary, but is, apparently, to Frank.
FRANK
Which. On the corner?
MARY
It’s nothing. She shouldn’t have
done it.
FRANK
(to Peggy)
Come with me.
EXT. GROCERY STORE - EVENING
Frank leads Peggy to the corner store.
FRANK
Stay here.
He leaves her on the sidewalk, disappears inside, comes
back out pushing a guy in an apron.
FRANK
This him?
Peggy nods. The grocer tries to look tough.
GROCER
I know judo.
Frank throws the guy to the ground, puts his hand on the
curb and stomps on it, crushing it.
FRANK
Let’s go. It’s dinner time.
Peggy is too stunned to move. Stares at the man writhing
on the ground.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
The family eats in silence. Peggy steals glances at her
father, afraid of him now.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 28.
FRANK V/O
No one in Philadelphia ever
touched any of my daughters again.
Grocers, teachers, boyfriends,
anybody. At least they never told
me about it.
INT. MOTHER OF SORROWS CHURCH - DAY
Frank’s third daughter is being baptized. The others
are there, along with lower-level guys like Skinny.
FRANK V/O
I still wasn’t making a lot of
money, but I was doing all right.
Then one day Whispers DiTullio
came over to my table at the Bocce
Club and asked me if I could use
ten grand.
INT. BOCCE CLUB - NIGHT
A short, furtive man in his 30’s sits with Frank, and,
true to his name, whispers too quietly for us to hear.
FRANK V/O
This is not the same Whispers
they blew up in that car around
the same time -
FLASHCUT to a car blowing up. Then back to the Bocce -
FRANK V/O
This is the other Whispers. The
one you always saw hanging around
wanting to be bigger than he was.
We have to come in closer in order to hear what Whispers
is whispering:
WHISPERS
I pushed a lot of money to
this place. More than I should.
More than I pushed anybody. Now
I’m lucky I get the vig.
FRANK V/O
He was talking about a linen
supply place.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 29.
INT. LINEN SUPPLY HOUSE - DAY
A big industrial laundry service, but with a lot of idle
machines.
FRANK V/O
They supplied fresh linen to
restaurants and hotels. Pick it
up, wash it, iron it, deliver it.
Normally, this was a license to
print money -
INT. BOCCE CLUB - CONTINUED
WHISPERS
Except this other laundry place,
down in Delaware, is siphoning off
a lot of their business.
INT. CADILLAC LINEN SERVICE - DAY
This place looks a lot like the other place, only busy.
WHISPERS V/O
I’m a little concerned my place,
because of this place, is gonna go
out of business and never be able
to pay me.
FRANK V/O
Whenever anybody says they’re a
little concerned, they are very
concerned. When they say they’re
more than a little concerned,
they’re desperate.
INT. BOCCE CLUB - CONTINUED
WHISPERS
I’m more than a little concerned.
EXT. CADILLAC LINEN SERVICE - DAY
As workers haul laundry out to Cadillac Linen Service
trucks -
FRANK V/O
I knew he didn’t want me to go
down there and show a gun. You
don’t pay ten grand for that.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 30.
INT. BOCCE CLUB - CONTINUED
Whispers passes an envelope across the table.
WHISPERS
I want you to bomb or torch or
burn this place to the ground, put
these fuckin guys out of business.
FRANK
Who.
WHISPERS
The Cadillac Linen Service.
The competition. Are you
listening?
FRANK
You need to speak up a little.
WHISPERS
I want them gone. Closed down.
Burned to the ground. They can go
collect their insurance, which
being Jews, you know they will,
and leave the other place the fuck
alone.
Frank takes a quick look inside the envelope.
FRANK
This isn’t ten grand.
WHISPERS
It’s two grand. You get the rest
if there’s nothing left of this
place. Nothing. I don’t want
them starting back up in a couple
weeks. Then nothing’s changed and
I’m out ten grand besides.
FRANK
Am I sure you’re good for it?
WHISPERS
I’m good for it. If I’m not
you’ll do something terrible to me
and I don’t want that. I just
want these Jew fucking washerwomen
burnt to the ground.
Frank studies him. Then puts the money in his pocket.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 31.
WHISPERS
One thing. We don’t mention this
to anybody. Including Skinny. We
see each other Downtown, we just
say hello, that’s it, like usual.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Frank takes five hundred from the stack of bills and
gives the rest to Mary, at the kitchen table with their
three girls.
FRANK
I hit on a four-dollar bet.
She knows it isn’t true, but doesn’t care. Peggy knows
it isn’t true and does care.
EXT. CADILLAC LINEN SERVICE - DELAWARE - DAY
Frank drives slowly past the front of the Cadillac Linen
Service building. Then around the side. Then around the
back. He notes a burglar alarm box.
EXT. CADILLAC LINEN SERVICE - DELAWARE - NIGHT
He sits in his parked car, having a look at the building
at night. Gets out and crosses past the trucks, peers in
one of the industrial windows at the washing and pressing
machines inside.
EXT. GAS STATION - DAY
He fills a 5-gallon can with gasoline. Puts it in the
trunk of his car where there are three more gas cans and
a box of dynamite.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
He puts a dark jacket over his dark clothes and heads
for the door -
EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE - CONTINUOUS - NIGHT
As he comes out and walks toward his car, he sees Skinny
standing next to his own, and stops.
SKINNY
Angelo wants to see you.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 32.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - LATER - NIGHT
Skinny leads Frank into the restaurant.
FRANK V/O
The place was empty except for
Angelo, Russell and Phil the bartender.
Everything was amplified
like on a landing craft headed
for a beachhead.
The squeak of the bartender’s bar towel as he wipes a
glass. The click as he sets it on a rack. His footsteps
as he walks to the door. The snap as he locks it. Even
the drip of wine falling back into Russell’s glass as he
dips his bread in it.
BRUNO
Sit down, Frank.
Frank sits. Listens to a silence before -
BRUNO
What’re you doing in Delaware?
Frank glances from Angelo Bruno - who’s studying him -
to Russell Bufalino - who isn’t - and wisely decides to
tell the truth.
FRANK
Blowing up a laundry service.
BRUNO
For who?
(nothing from Frank)
This is not one of those times to
not say.
FRANK
For Whispers. The other Whispers.
BRUNO
You know who owns the Cadillac
Linen Service?
FRANK
Some Jews in the laundry business.
BRUNO
They own part of it. Someone
else owns the other part. You
know who?
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 33.
FRANK
No.
BRUNO
I do.
FRANK
Who.
BRUNO
No. I do. I own the other part.
Not I know who owns the other
part.
FRANK
I didn’t know that. That’s
something I didn’t know.
BRUNO
Whispers didn’t tell you it was
Jew mob?
FRANK
He said Jew washerwomen.
BRUNO
Jew washerwomen. What else he
say? I’ll bet he said keep it to
yourself.
Frank nods. Listens to the amplified sounds. Then -
FRANK
I should’ve checked. I’m sorry
for not checking. I’ll give him
his money back.
BRUNO
He won’t need it. You can keep
it.
FRANK
You sure?
BRUNO
He won’t need it.
FRANK
Thank you.
BRUNO
Thank Russell. I wouldn’t have
wasted my time. I’d have let the
Jews have you.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 34.
FRANK
(to Russell)
Thank you.
Russell nods, you’re welcome, and finally speaks -
BUFALINO
This Whispers - like the other
Whispers - has aspirations. He
put you in a spot. If you had
done this, the only one the Jews
would know was you. They saw you
driving around. They would have
got you, and this Whispers would
have kept whatever he owed you.
FRANK
I don’t know for sure he’d do
that.
BUFALINO
If he didn’t, he thought about
it. That’s enough. When in doubt
have no doubt.
The three of them at the table freezes into a tableaux -
a poorly-attended Last Supper.
FRANK V/O
When someone has to go, no one
ever says, “he has to go.” They
tell you to do it by not telling
you not to. Or at most they say
“it’s what it is.”
The tableaux unfreezes. Bufalino shrugs.
BUFALINO
It’s what it is.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Whispers waits on the street. Sees Frank come around a
the corner and walk toward him - a friend walking toward
friend.
FRANK V/O
They found him dead on the
sidewalk, shot at close range with
a .32 by an unknown assailant.
Frank shoots him in the head and keeps walking.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 35.
FRANK V/O
All I know about it is I could
never find my .32 after that. It
must have ended up someplace.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - MORNING
Frank sits at the kitchen table reading a newspaper
article. There’s an accompanying Weegee-like photo of
Whispers’ body on the sidewalk.
FRANK V/O
The next morning I sat there
staring at the paper for an hour.
I kept thinking ... that could
have been me. And it would have
been if it wasn’t for Russell - no
questions asked. I owed him my
life.
INT/EXT. CADILLAC - WILKES BARRE - DAY - 1975
Frank and Russell drive along a street in Wilkes-Barre.
BUFALINO
Here it is.
Frank pulls to curb in front of a closed jewelry store.
FRANK
You want me to come in with you?
BUFALINO
No, I’m just picking something up.
As Russell goes into the store to collect some money,
Frank waits in the car.
FRANK V/O
After that, everyone started
treating me different.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - DAY - 1950’S
Frank and Skinny sit at the bar together.
FRANK V/O
Skinny wouldn’t let me pay for
drinks anymore.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 36.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - NIGHT - 1950’S
Frank and Angelo Bruno sit at a table together.
FRANK V/O
Angelo wouldn’t let me pay for
dinner.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - DAY - 1950’S
Frank and Russell sit at a table together.
FRANK V/O
Russell wouldn’t let me pay for
drinks after dinner.
The angle shifts to show two Jewish mobsters at the
table.
FRANK V/O
Even the laundry service Jews
who’d wanted me dead were nice to
me.
A waitress sets down another round of drinks.
FRANK V/O
Even the waitresses. Flirting.
You know.
The waitress gives Frank a smile.
FRANK V/O
All that separated who I was in
their eyes yesterday and who I was
today, was one thing - that
particular matter with Whispers
on the sidewalk. This did not
escape my notice.
EXT. PHILADELPHIA - NIGHT
Frank walks down a rain-slicked Downtown street with the
Villa d’Roma waitress.
FRANK V/O
I’d been drifting Downtown the
last couple years. Now I was way
down there. I was part of the
culture. I was a fixture like the
lights and the signs.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 37.
They step on reflections of lights and neon signs on the
wet pavement.
FRANK V/O
No time is a good time to leave
your wife, but that’s when I left
mine.
They disappear behind an apartment door on the corner.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - NIGHT
Frank sits at a table with a glass of wine, going over
a scribbled list of names and numbers on a small note pad
- crossing out some, underlining others.
FRANK V/O
I started pushing money of my own,
not just collecting for Skinny.
You could call this a step up, but
with any step up in business comes
headaches, too. The ladder of
success is not lined in silk,
necessarily.
He checks his watch. Looks at the door. Circles one of
the names on his list.
FRANK V/O
I had this one guy I made a loan
I couldn’t find anywhere. Skinny
tells me he seen him at Harry the
Hunchback’s bar, the Yesteryear,
where I catch up with him.
INT. THE YESTERYEAR - NIGHT
The guy whose name Frank circled is crying as he sits
with Frank, but not because he’s scared.
FRANK V/O
It turns out his mother died and
the funeral set him back the money
he owes me. I felt bad for him.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - NIGHT
Frank comes in, and Skinny looks up.
SKINNY
You get your money?
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 38.
FRANK
Not yet.
SKINNY
Let me guess. His mother died.
FRANK
You heard.
SKINNY
I heard ten years ago.
EXT. THE YESTERYEAR BAR - NIGHT
Frank parks and heads for the entrance -
INT. THE YESTERYEAR - CONTINUOUS
Frank strides over to the deadbeat’s booth and drags
him out of it. Beats him to a pulp until he’s lying in
his own blood on the floor. Harry the Hunchback comes
out from behind the bar and stares at Frank.
HARRY
What’re you doing?
FRANK
I got a problem with this guy.
HARRY
You got a problem, take him
outside. What am I supposed to do
about all this blood?
FRANK
He owes me money.
HARRY
He owes you money. He owes you
money? He owes me money. He’s
borrowing money from you and not
paying me?
Frank shrugs. Harry the Hunchback goes over to the guy
on the floor and starts kicking him.
EXT. WAREHOUSE DISTRICT - NIGHT
Two parked cars. Boxes of jewelry being transferred from
the trunk of one car to the other.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 39.
FRANK V/O
Another time, this guy gets a
load of hijacked jewelry and never
comes up with the money. When you
do something like that, you know
better.
INT. THE FRIENDLY LOUNGE - NIGHT
Frank sits at a table with a woman we recognize as a
younger Irene. Angelo Bruno and his wife are with them.
As the women talk to each other -
BRUNO
Russell needs a favor.
And, as Bruno talks to Frank in confidence -
FRANK V/O
Angelo wanted me to deliver a
message. This is after he already
delivered one telling the guy what
it is, so I know we’re past just
showing a gun.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
A car pulls up behind Frank’s parked car.
FRANK V/O
Now if you’re going to actually
use a gun, it should be a new one
that’s never been fired. You
don’t want to get blamed for
something somebody else did before
you even had it. So I recommend
one out of the box.
A guy climbs out and hands him a small paper bag through
the window. Frank sets it on the seat beside him and
pulls away.
FRANK V/O
What kind? That depends. The
cops call a .32 a woman’s gun
because it’s easier to handle and
has less kick than a .38. It also
makes less noise than a .38, and a
whole lot less noise than a .45.
Close on the paper bag as Frank keeps the car under the
speed limit.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 40.
FRANK V/O
But sometimes you want a lot of
noise. Like in the middle of the
day to scatter bystanders.
Sometimes you don’t want a lot of
noise. Like in the middle of the
night.
INT. THE “JEWELER’S” HOUSE - NIGHT
The “jeweler” wakes up to a noise - a kind of low
rumbling - and climbs out of bed to investigate, taking
a gun from his night stand with him.
FRANK V/O
The point of this is, if a
guy with welsh out on a load
of hijacked jewelry, there’s no
telling what he’s capable of
doing, or what he’s capable of
saying. He’s a rat in the making.
The “jeweler” follows the sound to a door off the
kitchen. Opens it and descends wooden steps to the
basement where a washing machine is running.
FRANK V/O
In orderly society, there are
certain rules that you follow and
that’s what it is.
The “jeweler” regards the washing machine, which is the
last thing he ever regards as a .32 behind his head pops.
INT. MOTEL LOBBY - MORNING - 1975
Frank and Russell are checking out of the Wilkes-Barre
motel.
BUFALINO
I got it.
FRANK
No, I got it.
BUFALINO
Frank. Please. I got it.
FRANK V/O
Russell and Carrie never had
children.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 41.
INT. BOWLING ALLEY - DAY - 1950’S
Russell and his wife Carrie, along with Frank and his
second wife, Irene, and his still-growing family - four
daughters now - bowl.
FRANK V/O
He adopted me, so to speak.
Russell helps one of Frank’s girls with a heavy ball.
Peggy - still unsure of him - keeps her distance.
BUFALINO V/O
Peggy’s afraid of me.
INT. BOWLING ALLEY - LATER
Frank and Russell drink beers and watch the women and
children bowl.
FRANK
She’s afraid of me.
BUFALINO
She is?
FRANK
She’s a sensitive girl.
Russell nods. Smiles at Peggy, but she looks away.
BUFALINO
You happy with what you’re doing,
Frank?
FRANK
It’s all right. I’d like it more
if it was more steady.
BUFALINO
Did you like driving a truck?
FRANK
Not so much, but I liked being
outdoors. And I liked being part
of something.
BUFALINO
The union.
FRANK
Yeah.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 42.
BUFALINO
What about union organizing?
FRANK
I looked into that. There’s a
long line.
BUFALINO
I imagine so. But things can
change. Like the weather. You
know what they say about the
weather.
He tells him in Sicilian.
FRANK
What’s that mean?
BUFALINO
The weather’s in God’s hands.
EXT. VILLA D’ROMA - NIGHT
A thunderstorm throws rain down on Frank he hurries from
his car to the Villa d’Roma.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - NIGHT
Summoned by Russell, Frank finds him at his usual table
with a telephone receiver to his ear.
FRANK
I’m sorry, I’ll wait over -
BUFALINO
Sit. Sit.
Frank sits. Into the phone -
BUFALINO
That friend I told you about is
here. Can I put him on?
He holds out the phone to Frank.
FRANK
Who is it?
BUFALINO
Friend of mine.
Frank takes the phone.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 43.
FRANK
Hello?
HOFFA
Frank?
FRANK
Yes.
HOFFA
It’s Jimmy Hoffa.
The image of Frank and Russell at the table freezes -
FRANK V/O
Nowadays, young people don’t
know who Jimmy Hoffa was. Maybe
they know he disappeared, that’s
it. But back then, there wasn’t
an American alive who didn’t
know who he was.
ELVIS PRESLEY on The Milton Berle Show. Hound Dog.
FRANK V/O
From 1955 to 1965, he was as
famous as Elvis.
THE BEATLES on The Ed Sullivan Show, but we keep hearing
Elvis.
FRANK V/O
From 1965 to 1975, he was as
famous as the Beatles.
The Elvis song continues over HOFFA orating before a
crowd of workers -
HOFFA
If you got it, a truck brought it
to you. Food, clothing, medicine,
fuel for homes and industry. The
day our trucks stop America stops.
BACK TO THE VILLA D’ROMA
as the image of Frank on the phone and Russell at the
table unfreezes -
HOFFA
I hear you’re a brother.
FRANK
Yes, sir. Local 107. Since 1947.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 44.
HOFFA
Our friend speaks very highly of
you. And he’s not an easy man to
please. Especially when you’re
Irish like us.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy was to labor what Russell
Bufalino was to me. A man among
men -
BACK TO THE TEAMSTER RALLY
Hoffa moves among his Teamster brothers, campaigning for
the union presidency -
FRANK V/O
Both believed the end justified
the means. Who doesn’t. Maybe
Bobby Kennedy and two or three
other people. At least that’s
what they say.
BACK TO THE VILLA D’ROMA
Frank still on the phone with Hoffa -
HOFFA
Management is working with the
government to sow dissent in our
ranks when what we need is unity.
We need solidarity more than ever
before in our history. Do you
want to be a part of history,
Frank?
FRANK
Yes, I do.
HOFFA
Can you be in Chicago tomorrow?
EXT. CHICAGO - DAY
Cars pull into a parking lot behind a building.
HOFFA V/O
Go to Chicago. Speak to Joey
Glimco at Local 777. You’ll be
working in Public Relations.
Frank and Joey Glimco climb out of one of the cars.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 45.
(MORE)
FRANK V/O
Joey Glimco - who was not known
for his physical stature - he was
almost as short as Jimmy - ran
Local 777 in Chicago.
Frank and Joey Glimco and several other men enter the
back door of the building -
FRANK V/O
You’d never know how much he
liked to eat, because of his size,
but he liked to eat.
INT. BATHHOUSE - CONTINUOUS
The men come through the tiled bathhouse and head for the
locker room.
FRANK V/O
But you could never be sure who
might be listening at meetings at
restaurants, or even at the Local
itself, so when there was a
meeting Joey would organize it at
a place that was safe.
The men come past long folding tables where food is being
laid out.
FRANK V/O
They’d close the place to the
public and bring in the food and
wine and put it on long tables.
The men are now in white robes, eating.
FRANK V/O
We’d sit in Turkish bathrobes,
eat and drink and discuss union
business. We’d get a massage,
then eat again. We’d take a steam
bath and sweat out all the food
and alcohol, take a shower and
start eating again.
The men look like ghosts in the steam-filled room.
FRANK V/O
The problem that summer wasn’t
management.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 46.
It was Paul HalFlR’AsN KS eVa/fOa(rCeOrNsT 'D)
Union, which was with the AFL-CIO,
which was trying to organize the
same non-union cab drivers we were
trying to organize. This is what
we had to deal with. This is what
we discussed. How to encourage
these drivers to join us rather
than Paul’s union.
EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT
Frank stares up at the underside of a dashboard of a car
he’s hot-wiring.
FRANK V/O
If a rebel cabbie left his cab
at a stand and went in for a cup
of coffee, he came out to find
his cab gone.
EXT. LAKE MICHIGAN - NIGHT
Several pairs of headlights move along a road leading
to Lake Michigan. All of them belong to cabs. Frank is
driving one of them.
FRANK V/O
After that, he’d never see it
again.
Frank and the other “cab drivers,” Local 777 guys, push
the cabs into the lake while cops stand around watching.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy had Mayor Daley’s
cooperation on this. The cops
wouldn’t help us push, but they
made sure no one stopped us.
One of the men is going from cop to cop handing over
envelopes as the others push the cabs into the water.
FRANK V/O
We dumped a lot of cabs in Lake
Michigan, which proved to be a lot
of work - especially for Joey -
who, as I said, was not a big man.
The work of dumping the cars in the lake exhausts Joey.
FRANK V/O
I told him maybe it would be
easier if we used candy instead.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 47.
EXT. CHICAGO - NIGHT
The trunk of a car opens revealing boxes of dynamite.
Joey and Frank carry the boxes to a back door of a cab
garage, held open by another man.
INT. CAB GARAGE - NIGHT
The place is silent. Full of taxi cabs. Suddenly they
start exploding -
FRANK V/O
Then we’d report to Jimmy.
INT. GROCERY STORE - CHICAGO - NIGHT
Joey Glimco taps watermelons to find a good one.
JOEY
One thing about Jimmy, never make
him wait. You have a meeting with
him, get there on time. Get there
early. Seriously.
FRANK
Then pick one and let’s go.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - CHICAGO - LATER - NIGHT
Joey carefully cuts a hole in a watermelon. Frank checks
his watch.
FRANK V/O
The other thing about Jimmy -
he didn’t drink. I know - an
Irishman who doesn’t drink - but
he didn’t drink - and didn’t like
people drinking around him. It
was also common knowledge he
didn’t like watermelon.
Joey pours a quart of rum into the hole in the watermelon,
then hides the bottle.
INT. HOTEL SUITE - LATER - NIGHT
They sip from bottles of ginger ale - Joey, Frank and
Jimmy Hoffa - but only two of them are eating watermelon.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 48.
JOEY
I never seen a man walk through
a crowd like Frank does and never
touch a single person. Everybody
parts out of his way. It’s like
Moses.
Jimmy nods to himself as he studies Frank. It’s like
they’re alone in the room.
HOFFA
Maybe you should stay in Chicago
a while.
FRANK
Whatever you want.
Jimmy seems pleased. Joey sucks on a slice of laced
watermelon. To both of them -
HOFFA
You two sure like watermelon.
EXT. CHICAGO - DAY
Frank and Jimmy sit alone in the back of a parked car.
The driver smokes outside it.
HOFFA
Everybody has to be united in
the same direction or there’s no
progress for the worker, Frank.
Dissenters are like Nazi
collaborators. You were in the
war. You know what I mean. You
know what happens when you got to
get from Point A to Point B.
Sometimes a little beer spills on
the way. With that in mind, I’m
wondering if you’d help me
straighten out a couple matters.
All you got to do is show up.
Everything else is taken care of.
You can do it in a day. Will you
do this for me?
He waits for Frank’s answer to this thoroughly vague
assignment.
FRANK
Sure.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 49.
EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE - PHILLY - DAY
A car pulls up in front of Frank’s house. The driver
takes his overnight bag from the trunk and carries it for
him to his front door.
FRANK V/O
All in one day I flew to Puerto
Rico, took care of a matter there
for him, flew to Detroit and took
care of a matter there, another in
Chicago, and came home.
EXT. MINIATURE GOLF COURSE - NIGHT
Frank’s wife Irene and daughters, and Jimmy and his wife,
Josephine, play miniature golf. Jimmy dotes on Peggy,
helps her with the club.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy fell for my daughter Peggy
right away. And she fell for him.
Maybe because she thought he
wasn’t like Russell and me and my
other associates - he was
legitimate or so she thought - and
no one would get their fingers
broken.
JO HOFFA
Smile.
Jo Hoffa snaps a picture of Jimmy and Peggy together.
INT. CLASSROOM - DAY
Peggy stands in front of a blackboard reading an essay
from a piece of paper.
PEGGY
If you have it, a truck brought
it to you. This is what Mr. Hoffa
says, and it’s true. He’s the
president of the Teamsters union.
He started its Pension Fund.
Before that, the workers had
nothing but Social Security when
they retired, which you can’t live
on. The Pension Fund changed that.
It must be Career Day. Frank’s in a chair next to her
as she goes on with her essay.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 50.
FRANK V/O
The Pension Fund changed everything.
It was what everything was
about. And Jimmy had complete
authority over it. He decided who
could borrow from it and who
couldn’t.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY
Irene brings out a candle-lit birthday cake for Peggy.
Frank, Jimmy and Jo are the only other adults there.
FRANK V/O
It’s basically the same as what
I did with Skinny: loan money for
a fee to guys like that deadbeat
at Harry the Hunchback’s bar whose
mother didn’t die. Only Jimmy
loaned money to the biggest guys
in the mob.
A SERIES OF SHOTS
of six particular bosses in their legitimate places of
business - restaurants, dry cleaners, bars, social clubs -
and cooking dinners in their homes.
FRANK V/O
He loaned money to Santo
Trafficante. To Meyer Lansky.
To Carlos Marchello down in New
Orleans. To Tony Salerno and Tony
Provenzano in New Jersey. To my
boss and friend, Russell in
Philadelphia.
INT. CURTAIN SHOP - PITTSTON, PA. - DAY
Russell in his legitimate place of business again - his
curtain shop - discussing fabric with someone.
FRANK V/O
And even when Russell wasn’t
borrowing, he was at the table
getting a taste of what was on it.
EXT. ATLANTIC CITY - DAY
A guy looks at a vacant building site.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 51.
(MORE)
FRANK V/O
Let’s say a guy wants to build a
hotel. He goes to the Teamsters
for a loan -
INT. OFFICE - DAY
The guy meets with another guy in a Teamster office.
The one behind the desk wears a pin with the Teamster
logo on his lapel.
FRANK V/O
He sees Allen Dorfman - who
managed the Fund for Jimmy - who
is happy to make the loan, but
wants to make sure the Fund gets
paid back. So he tells the guy to
meet with Russell who he knows
will make sure the guy pays back
or else.
INT. CURTAIN SHOP - PITTSTON, PA - DAY
The guy who wants the loan speaks to Russell in the
curtain shop.
FRANK V/O
Russell tells the guy he'll
help him get the loan - for which
he tacks on a 10-percent fee -
which he splits with Dorfman who
splits that with Jimmy.
INT. BANK - DAY
Money being put into safety deposit boxes.
FRANK V/O
Just like everything else, no
one eats alone, and no one chokes.
EXT. LAS VEGAS - DAY
back before all the goofy hotels went up, back when it
still looked like a desert dotted with building cranes.
FRANK V/O
The Fund was the mob’s own
private bank and with it they
flourished.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 52.
Teamster money FbRuAiNlKt Vt/hOe( CcOaNsTi'nDo)s
in Havana and Las Vegas and
Atlantic City.
A counting machine in a counting room in one of the
casinos, counts money.
FRANK V/O
That Pension Fund was the golden
goose that laid the golden eggs.
INT. BEAUTY PARLOR - DAY
Several women sitting under hair dryers.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy also invested part of the
Fund in his own ventures - which
were always kept in his wife,
Josephine’s, name.
We move across the women to find Jo Hoffa.
FRANK V/O
She owned, so to speak, a fleet
of Cadillac carriers, some charter
fishing boats, twenty-two percent
of a Florida land development
called Sun Valley - that sort of
thing.
EXT. CHICAGO - DAY
A man in sunglasses sits at a sidewalk table sipping an
espresso - the same man from the earlier scene who we saw
shot as he was frying eggs and sausages.
FRANK V/O
One of Jimmy’s clients was Sam
‘Momo’ Giancana, who was friends
with the Kennedys from back when
Jack’s father made his money alongside
the Italians as a bootlegger
during Prohibition.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - CHICAGO - DAY
Some men walk across the lawns of a graveyard, jotting
down the names on the tombstones.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 53.
FRANK V/O
Momo helped Joe Kennedy get his
womanizing son elected president
by making sure he won in Illinois.
INT. POLLING PLACE - CHICAGO - DAY
One of the men from the graveyard signs one of the names
from the tombstones on the voting register.
FRANK V/O
In exchange, Jack was going to
get Castro out of Cuba so Momo and
his friends could get their
casinos in Havana back.
INT. HOUSE - DAY
Jimmy Hoffa watches Kennedy’s inauguration on TV.
FRANK V/O
But Jimmy didn’t trust Jack and
Bobby for one reason. They were
millionaire kids.
JIMMY
If there’s one person you can’t
trust it’s millionaire kids.
FRANK V/O
It didn’t matter they were Irish.
It didn’t matter they were
Catholic. Jimmy didn’t like them.
Especially Bobby, who on top of
being a millionaire’s kid, was
mental.
A shot of Robert Kennedy as his brother is sworn in.
FRANK V/O
The Teamsters were the only
union to back Nixon.
INT. SENATE CHAMBERS - DAY
The McClellan Committee senators are arriving.
FRANK V/O
So what is the first thing Jack
Kennedy does when he wins? He puts
his crazy brother in charge of the
Justice Department.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 54.
Jimmy Hoffa is already there - on time like always -
looking irritated that he’s been made to wait - sitting
with his union attorneys, including Bill Bufalino. Bobby
Kennedy arrives and takes the center seat. Jimmy covers
the microphone and turns to Bill -
HOFFA
He’s fifteen minutes late.
FRANK V/O
And what is the first thing he
does? He goes after not just
Jimmy - which in a way you could
understand - but Giancana and all
the other guys who put his brother
in the White House.
Hoffa raises his right hand, and is sworn in.
FRANK V/O
I don’t know where you learn
something like that. I guess in
Massachusetts, which is a place
I’ve never liked - except for the
clam chowder, which isn’t bad.
Bobby Kennedy regards Hoffa like he’s an insect.
BOBBY
Are you saying you don’t remember
doing any favors for Johnny Dio or
you don’t remember the
conversation?
HOFFA
I’m saying, to the best of my
recollection, I must recall on my
memory, I cannot remember.
BOBBY
Where did this twenty thousand
dollars come from?
HOFFA
From individuals.
BOBBY
Which individuals?
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 55.
HOFFA
Offhand, that particular amount
of money I borrowed I don’t know
at this particular moment, but the
record of my loans, which I
requested, I have, and out of all
the moneys I loaned over this
period of time I went into these
ventures.
Everyone looks at each other to see if that made any
sense to them.
FRANK V/O
The two of them were like that
story about the guy who chases the
whale. Only with Bobby and Jimmy,
they were both chasing it. And at
the same time were both the thing
being chased.
INT. NIGHTCLUB - KINGSTON - DAY - 1975
The place is closed. Empty except for Frank at the bar
with a beer, and the owner and Russell, who Frank can see
beyond a doorway to a back room. The owner gives Russell
an envelope.
FRANK V/O
When you’re starting out, you
always arrived for a meeting with
someone like Russell with an
envelope.
INT. BUFALINO’S HOUSE - NIGHT - 1960’S
Christmas lights glow on a tree. Sinatra sings from a
hifi. Wearing an apron, Russell slices meat off a leg of
prosciutto and stirs it into a simmering pot of sauce.
FRANK V/O
It wasn’t payment for anything.
No one was “paid” for anything.
It was how you showed your
respect.
FRANK
Is there anything you don’t put
prosciutto in?
BUFALINO
No.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 56.
INT. BUFALINO’S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
Russell and Carrie, and Frank and Irene and the girls eat
Christmas dinner together.
FRANK V/O
But Russell wouldn’t accept
envelopes from me anymore.
INT. BUFALINO’S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
Now they sit around the Christmas tree, opening gifts.
FRANK V/O
Instead he gave them to me, in
the form of jewelry for my wife,
and gifts for my girls.
Peggy, as always, is uncomfortable in Russell’s presence.
INT. BUFALINO’S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
Frank and Russell retire to the den to drink some
limoncello and talk in private.
FRANK V/O
By this time, with the Kennedys
running things, everyone was sure
everyone’s phone was bugged. You
couldn’t say anybody’s name on the
phone anymore. Everybody was
“that friend,” or “your friend,”
or “our friend,” whether they were
your friends or not. When you
talked about Bobby Kennedy, he was
“our friend.” You could barely
talk on the phone anymore.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY - FLASHBACK
Frank has his kitchen phone to his ear.
BUFALINO
We need to talk about our friend.
FRANK
That’s done. I took care of it.
BUFALINO
I’m talking about our other
friend.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 57.
FRANK
The one we talked about.
BUFALINO
No, the other one.
Frank doesn’t know what he’s talking about.
FRANK
We should talk in person.
BUFALINO
I’m meet you at the place.
FRANK
The place last time.
BUFALINO
No, the other place.
FRANK V/O
It was impossible. You may as
well throw the phone away.
BACK TO BUFALINO’S DEN AT CHRISTMAS
- where Frank and Russell can speak English -
BUFALINO
Jack, supposedly, is doing
something about Cuba. The old
man, supposedly, had a word with
him. Finally he’s giving us an
envelope, supposedly.
EXT. PHILLY - DAY
Frank drives himself to a South Philly trucking company,
climbs out of his car and speaks to a guy.
BUFALINO V/O
You need to go see Phil at
Milestone Hauling. He’ll have a
rig for you.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Frank behind the wheel of a Milestone semi.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 58.
BUFALINO V/O
Drive it down to Baltimore to a
concrete plant on Eastern Avenue.
It’s the only one there.
EXT. CONCRETE PLANT - BALTIMORE - DAY
Frank pulls the rig onto the grounds of the plant.
There’s a little landing strip next to it.
BUFALINO V/O
A guy will meet you there. A
fairy named Ferrie.
Dave Ferrie climbs out of a small plane on the landing
strip and directs Frank to back his rig up to where some
army trucks are parked.
BUFALINO V/O
You’ll pick up some things and
he’ll give you some paperwork for
the load in case you get stopped.
Frank watches some Maryland National Guardsmen transfer
weapons and ammunition from their trucks to his.
EXT. HIGHWAY - NIGHT
Frank drives the rig down Route 13.
BUFALINO V/O
Drive the truck down to Florida.
That’s where you’ll leave it. At
a dog track outside Jacksonville.
EXT. JACKSONVILLE, FLORIDA - DAWN
Frank pulls the truck onto the parking lot of a deserted
dog track.
BUFALINO V/O
A guy with big ears will meet
you there and give you a car to
get you back to Philly.
As the guy gives Frank the keys to a car, Frank regards
his ears. They don’t look so big.
BIG EARS
What are you looking at? You
looking at my ears?
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 59.
(MORE)
FRANK
No.
BIG EARS
I had an operation, so there’s no
need for anyone looking at my ears
anymore.
Big Ears walks away. Frank climbs into the car and
watches as a bunch of Cubans begin unloading the weapons
and ammo from the truck.
FRANK V/O
Russell and Giancana and Lansky
and the rest figured Castro was a
lot like them. He was a boss. He
had a crew. He had territory.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY
Frank drives the car back up north.
FRANK V/O
But he had come onto their
territory and took their property.
No one is supposed to get away
with that.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Frank, Irene, Peggy and another daughter, Delores,
watch a report on TV about the just-failed Bay of Pigs
invasion.
FRANK V/O
Everybody knows what happened
after that. Jack Kennedy fucked
it up. He was supposed to provide
air cover and at the last minute
didn’t. The poor saps who weren’t
killed outright on the beach were
rounded up and who knows what
happened to them after that.
Castro makes an anti-American speech on the TV.
FRANK V/O
Everybody else did what they
were supposed to do - even that
fairy Ferrie - but those millionaire
Kennedys could fuck up a onecar
funeral, and did.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 60.
Everybody DowntFoRwAnN Ks tVa/rOt(eCdO NT'D)
thinking the same thing - maybe
Jimmy was right about them.
EXT. MIAMI - DAY
The sun-bleached coastline of Miami Beach in 1961.
Everyone in short-sleeves and sunglasses.
FRANK V/O
But Cuba or no Cuba, there was
still a union to run.
EXT. DEAUVILLE HOTEL - MIAMI - DAY
Frank climbs out of a cab. A bellman helps him with his
luggage. Everyone else arriving looks just as much like
a gangster as he does.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy appointed me sergeantat-
arms at the 1961 International
convention. It was first one I
ever attended.
INT. DEAUVILLE HOTEL - MIAMI - DAY
Frank stands next to check-in tables outside a ballroom,
scrutinizing the faces of those showing their union cards
to clerks for admittance.
FRANK V/O
One of the matters approved
was an increase to the expense
account. For someone like me who
traveled a lot on union business,
I appreciated that.
INT. DEAUVILLE HOTEL BALLROOM - MIAMI - DAY
While Jimmy addresses the convention delegates, Frank
surveys them, looking at their hands for cameras or guns.
FRANK V/O
The other big thing was filling
the International vice president
position vacated by Owen Brennan
who died about a month before of
a heart attack. Jimmy chose
Frank Fitzsimmons.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 61.
Fitzsimmons gets a handshake from Jimmy as he joins him
at the podium.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy used to always say, “I may
have faults, but being wrong isn’t
one of them.” But with Fitz ...
well, we know how that went.
INT. DEAUVILLE HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
Jimmy pours Frank a glass of ginger ale.
FRANK V/O
One thing that wasn’t discussed
on the convention floor but was on
Jimmy’s mind, was Philly.
HOFFA
I’m a little concerned about
Philly. I’m a little concerned
about Joe McGreal.
EXT/INT. TRUCKING COMPANY - DAY
Joe McGreal walks into a trucking company office where
the owner has an envelope waiting for him.
FRANK V/O
Joe McGreal was part of a rebel
faction in Local 107. He was also
a shake-down artist.
BACK TO THE HOTEL SUITE
HOFFA
Guys like that give the union a
bad name.
FRANK
I’ll take care of it.
HOFFA
No, I don’t want that. I want
you to run for president of the
Local. If you run, I guarantee
you you’ll win. That’ll take
care of the McGreal matter.
Frank is stunned by Jimmy’s belief in him, if that’s
what it is.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 62.
HOFFA
You’re like family to me, Frank,
but that’s not why I’m doing this.
I’m not giving you anything you
didn’t earn.
FRANK
I don’t know what to say.
HOFFA
Say you’ll do it. That’s all you
have to say.
FRANK
I’ll do it.
HOFFA
Then it’s done. You want some
watermelon?
FRANK
What?
Jimmy smiles, but leaves it at that.
EXT. TRUCKING COMPANY - PHILADELPHIA - DAY
Frank parks his Cadillac near the loading docks of the
same trucking company McGreal shook down, and climbs out.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy was right about his
guarantee. I won the election.
Maybe I won on my own. I’ll
never know.
INT. TRUCKING COMPANY OFFICE - DAY
Frank comes into the same office where McGreal picked up
the envelope.
FRANK V/O
But I’m proud to say McGreal
never shook down another employer
in Philadelphia. Or, if he did,
I never heard about it.
The trucking company owner takes an envelope from his
desk to give to Frank, but Frank shakes his head no.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 63.
FRANK
I just wanted to come over and
introduce myself. Frank Sheeran.
President of Local 107.
The owner is stunned, figures there’s something else
afoot, but tentatively shakes Frank’s hand.
INT. LOCAL 107 OFFICE - DAY
Frank in his own office now, behind a desk, working with
some union guys on legitimate business.
FRANK V/O
This was as happy as I’d ever
been. Or would ever be. And it
might have gone on forever if it
wasn’t for that nut in Nashville.
INT. COURTROOM - NASHVILLE - DAY
A recess. Jimmy conferring with his attorneys at the
defense table. The prosecution lawyers at their table.
Spectators milling around.
FRANK V/O
Bobby’s Kennedy’s Get Hoffa Squad
had Jimmy on trial in Tennessee
for the car-carrier company in his
wife’s name. She was also part
owner of that Florida landdevelopment
company bought with
union funds I mentioned, but that
trial was in Chicago, and the nut
was in Nashville, not Chicago.
A young man in a raincoat emerges from the milling crowds
and walks down the aisle toward the defense table.
FRANK V/O
Some people say you always run
away from a guy with a knife and
toward a guy with a gun. I don’t
know that I agree with that.
The nut pulls out a gun and points it at Jimmy, who
rushes the guy, grabbing his arm. The gun goes off and
everyone scrambles for cover, but Jimmy has hold the nut,
wrestles him to floor and beats on him with his gun until
the marshals get there and take over.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 64.
(MORE)
FRANK V/O
Jimmy asked me to come down to be
with him after that. I would have
done it without being asked, but
he asked.
INT. COURTHOUSE - NASHVILLE - DAY
Frank, Jimmy’s bodyguard now, walks alongside Jimmy
toward the courtroom.
FRANK V/O
During the day, I watched out for
nuts in the courthouse.
INT. ANDREW JACKSON HOTEL - NASHVILLE - NIGHT
The camera makes a trip around the suite to see who the
occupants are, beginning with another bodyguard sitting
in a chair in the open doorway -
FRANK V/O
At night, Ed Partin watched out
for them and I watched television -
Frank sits watching the unfolding events of the Cuban
Missile Crisis on the TV, jacket off, gun on the coffee
table.
FRANK V/O
- while Jimmy strategized with
his attorneys in his suite at the
Andrew Jackson Hotel, which, apart
from being a very nice hotel, had
excellent fried chicken.
We regard each of the attorneys as they eat fried
chicken.
FRANK V/O
Frank Ragato was Santo
Trafficante’s lawyer, loaned to
Jimmy as a favor. Bill Bufalino -
no relation to Russell as I
mentioned - was the union lawyer
out of Detroit. Tommy Osborn was
very young and very smart.
Jimmy, the only one not eating chicken, paces -
FRANK V/O
Jimmy had reason to be a little
concerned.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 65.
People were actFuRaAlNlKy Vg/oOi(nCgO NtTo' Dj)ail
because of the millionaire’s son.
Johnny Roselli for one. Carlos
Marcello for another. Even
Russell was being investigated.
Back to Frank watching the TV.
FRANK V/O
The Cuban Missile Crisis is going
on - the world could end any day -
and what is the government doing?
Going after Jimmy.
EXT. HIGHWAY - TENNESSEE - DAY
Deserted stretch of highway. A lone Lincoln Towncar
parked on the shoulder.
FRANK V/O
And what is he doing?
A Tennessee State Highway Patrol car pulls over and
parks. But rather than what normally happens, a man gets
out of the Towncar, walks to the police car and hands the
trooper an envelope, returns to his own car, drives off.
INT. ANDREW JACKSON HOTEL SUITE - NIGHT
Jimmy and his lawyers arrange surveillance photos of
jurors on a coffee table. To one on which someone has
already written “Patrolman’s Wife,” Jimmy adds a checkmark
flourish.
Frank is in the same chair as before, again watching
television. Ed Partin is in the same chair as before in
the doorway, again watching for nuts.
FRANK V/O
And what is Ed Partin doing?
INT. A BATHROOM SOMEWHERE - DAY
Ed Partin removes tape that holds a small tape recorder
to his ribs -
INT. OFFICE - DAY
- and places it on the coffee table in federal prosecutor
Walter Sheridan’s office.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 66.
FRANK V/O
And what happens?
INT. COURTROOM - NASHVILLE - DAY
The man who rendezvoused with the trooper out on the
highway is called to the stand. As he raises his right
hand to be sworn in, Jimmy, at the defense table, raises
his own and spreads his fingers. The man nods.
FRANK V/O
The Teamster who made the Ten-K
payoff to the juror’s patrolman
husband took the Fifth.
The Teamster witness leans into the microphone -
TEAMSTER
On the advice of counsel, I
respectfully decline to answer
that question under the protection
afforded me by the Constitution.
SHERIDAN
All I asked is are you a member
of the International Brotherhood
of Teamsters.
WITNESS
One the advice of counsel, I
respectfully decline to answer -
FRANK V/O
But it didn’t matter. They had
Ed Partin’s tape. And Jimmy now
had jury-tampering to add to his
list of woes.
INT. LOCAL 107 - PHILADELPHIA - DAY
Frank comes into the lobby from the street and is
surprised to find it empty. Not even the security guard
is there.
FRANK V/O
The only bright spot for Jimmy
during all this was what happened
that November.
He comes down a hall and finds everyone standing around a
television set. To them -
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 67.
FRANK
What is it?
No one says anything. Some are weeping. He looks at
the TV and surmises what we already know: John Kennedy
has been shot in Dallas.
EXT. WASHINGTON DC - DAY
All the flags are at half-staff except the one outside
Teamster headquarters in DC. As Jimmy emerges from the
building, a news crew intercepts him.
REPORTER
Mr. Hoffa, will you be attending
the service?
HOFFA
I wasn’t invited.
REPORTER
You don’t have to be invited.
A million Americans will be there.
HOFFA
In that case, I need to check my
schedule.
Jimmy continues toward his waiting car, trailed by the
news crew.
REPORTER
If you were to go, and were asked
to speak, what would you say?
HOFFA
I’d say Bobby Kennedy is just
another lawyer now.
TV IMAGE
The slain president’s solemn funeral procession Jimmy
isn’t part of. A camera focuses on Robert Kennedy.
FRANK V/O
Bobby didn’t know who was behind
the matter in Dallas any more than
anyone else. But he knew he was
to blame. He knew how things
worked.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 68.
Mob bosses are among the mourners paying their respects,
or trying to appear so. Russell, Tony Salerno, Colombo,
Giancana.
FRANK V/O
A boss has a problem with another
boss, he doesn’t fix it by kissing
an underboss. To kill a dog, you
cut off its head, not its tail.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - NIGHT
Russell sits with his wife at his usual table, dipping
prosciutto bread in wine.
FRANK V/O
The second that bullet took the
top of Jack Kennedy’s head off the
Organized Crime program just
stopped.
INT. COURTROOM - NASHVILLE - DAY
Jimmy regards the jury, which has just rendered its
verdict. Frank watches from his usual spot in the back
of the courtroom.
FRANK V/O
It just came a little too late for
Jimmy whose trials were already
underway.
The judge motions to Jimmy to rise. Jimmy stands.
JUDGE
Mr. Hoffa, most defendants that
stand before this court for
sentencing have either violated
the property rights or personal
rights of other individuals. You
stand here convicted of having
tampered with, really, the very
soul of this nation.
EXT. HIGHWAY - DAY - 1975
The Cadillac parked at the side of the highway. All the
luggage is out of the trunk. As Frank and Russell change
a flat tire, the wives seize the opportunity for a
cigarette. A truck roar by and -
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 69.
EXT. PENNSYLVANIA - DAY - 1960’S
- a prison bus roars past on the same highway.
FRANK V/O
He got eight years for that.
EXT. LEWISBURG FEDERAL PENITENTIARY - DAY
The black bus pulls past the gates of the penitentiary.
FRANK V/O
And another five for the Sun
Valley land development thing.
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY
Jimmy Hoffa - Inmate No. 33298-NE - is fingerprinted
and photographed and given a blue denim prison uniform.
FRANK V/O
That’s thirteen years of school.
But it could have been worse. It
could have been some place other
than Lewisburg.
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY
Jimmy and several other Teamsters and mobsters eat
spaghetti and meatballs and ice cream in the cafeteria.
FRANK V/O
Lewisburg is where they put
everyone from Downtown, and they
pretty much ran the place. Lunch
time was like Happy Hour at the
Friendly Lounge. Jimmy said they
had the best ice cream he’d ever
tasted, and he loved ice cream.
INT. VISITORS ROOM - LEWISBURG - DAY
Jimmy sits with his lawyers at a table. Opposite him is
an empty chair.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 70.
(MORE)
FRANK V/O
Question 41 in the Federal
Correctional Institutions brochure
is: “How can I take care of my
business while in confinement,”
and the answer is: “You must
appoint someone else to run your
business while you are confined.”
A visitor - Frank “Fitz” Fitzsimmons - comes in and sits
down in the empty chair.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy chose Frank Fitzsimmons.
Fitz’s main qualification was he
was weak. Jimmy could control
him. Fitz liked to drink and play
golf and that was about it.
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
Fitzsimmons whacks a golf ball off a tee.
FRANK V/O
The problem is - weakness is a
weakness, and that leads to other
problems. But in Lewisburg, Jimmy
had the other thing to be
concerned about. The Little Guy
from Jersey - Tony Provenzano.
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY
Provenzano, who is even smaller than Jimmy, moves down
the cafeteria line alongside much taller inmates.
FRANK V/O
Tony Pro - before he went to
school for a semester for extortion
- ran things in New Jersey
for Tony Salerno. He also ran a
Teamster Local in north Jersey.
EXT. NEW JERSEY - DAY
A car drives down a highway past farms.
FRANK V/O
I never liked Pro. He’d kiss you
for nothing.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 71.
One time he hadF RaA NgKu yV /kOi(sCsOeNdT 'fDo)r
getting more votes than him in a
union election - and they were on
the same ticket.
INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY
The guy in the passenger seat fiddles with the radio.
FRANK V/O
He just couldn’t stand someone
being more popular than him and
had Sally Bugs strangle the poor
guy with a nylon rope and bury
him on a farm.
As the guy settles on a station and sits back in his
seat, Sally Bugs, in the back seat, loops a rope around
his neck and strangles him -
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - CONTINUED - DAY
Pro sits at Jimmy’s table with his tray of food. Jimmy’s
done with his, except for his ice cream, which he savors.
PRO
I got to talk to you about a
problem I got with my pension.
HOFFA
I know.
PRO
You know? What do you know?
HOFFA
I know you’re having a problem
with that.
PRO
Will you look into for me?
HOFFA
There’s nothing to look into. It
is what it is.
PRO
What is it?
HOFFA
You lost it. You forfeited it
when you came here.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 72.
PRO
Yours is forfeited, too?
HOFFA
No.
Pro can’t imagine why his is gone and Jimmy’s isn’t,
but Jimmy doesn’t elaborate. He just eats his ice cream.
Eventually -
PRO
Your pension is still there.
HOFFA
Un-huh.
PRO
We’re both sitting here.
HOFFA
We’re both sitting here for
different things. You’re sitting
here for extortion. I’m sitting
here for fraud.
PRO
So?
HOFFA
So that’s the difference.
PRO
I don’t see the difference.
HOFFA
I didn’t threaten anybody, you
did.
PRO
So what? That makes no sense.
HOFFA
It does if you think about it.
PRO
It doesn’t, but I don’t want to
debate. Just do something about
it.
HOFFA
There’s nothing I can do.
PRO
There’s always something you can
do.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 73.
HOFFA
It’s Federal law.
PRO
I don’t care. You can still do
something about it.
HOFFA
I can’t. What can I do.
PRO
You can get me my fuckin money.
HOFFA
How?
PRO
Some other way.
HOFFA
What way.
PRO
The same way you got your money.
HOFFA
I earned my money.
PRO
You’re here for fraud. You stole
money. I stole money. Okay, in a
different way. Fine. Still. I
want what I’m owed.
HOFFA
You people.
PRO
What?
HOFFA
What?
PRO
What did you say?
HOFFA
I can’t help you.
PRO
You people, you said. What does
that mean, you people.
HOFFA
I’m tired of talking about this.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 74.
PRO
You people?
Jimmy ignores him. Eats his ice cream like Pro’s not
there. Suddenly Pro lunges across the table, and grabs
him. They tumble to the floor and fight until the guards
get there to break it up.
INT. SHOE STORE - OHIO - DAY - 1975
Irene and Carrie try on dress shoes. Russell collects
an envelope from the store owner. Frank regards a row
of mens shoes including a tasseled pair with spikes -
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
Fitzsimmons, as he is so often, is back on the golf
course, lining up a putt.
FRANK V/O
So Jimmy had the Pro problem,
and he had the Fitz problem. The
Fitz problem was everyone Downtown
liked him. He’d make Pension Fund
loans to people Jimmy never would.
And after the Dorfman thing, he
even lowered the interest.
EXT. ALLEN DORFMAN’S HOUSE - DAY
A garage door opens automatically. The man behind the
Lincoln Continental backs out.
FRANK V/O
Allen Dorfman, you remember, ran
the Fund. He was an ex-Marine and
had worked with Jimmy a long time.
He was one tough Jew.
The windows of the Lincoln suddenly explode from shotgun
blasts. Holes erupt in the body of the car.
FRANK V/O
His car was hit - I don’t know -
fifty times. The car - not him -
is the point I’m trying to make.
Dorfman yanks the glove compartment open to get to his
gun as the shotgun blasts keep pocking the car.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 75.
FRANK V/O
That’s not how you kiss somebody.
That’s how you send a
message. But the message wasn’t
for him, because, like I said,
he wasn’t afraid of anybody.
As the dust settles, Dorfman can’t quite believe he’s
not dead.
EXT. WRECKING YARD - DAY
The Lincoln is destroyed. Dorfman is fine. Fitz regards
the car nervously.
FRANK V/O
The message was for Fitz, who
everyone knew had no balls. After
that, anybody who wanted anything
from the Pension Fund got it.
A TV IMAGE
shows Robert Kennedy making an announcement.
FRANK V/O
When Bobby announced he was
running for president, he had to
step down as Attorney General.
Lyndon Johnson replaced him with
Ramsey Clark.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - NIGHT
A celebration is going on at the bar. Frank is there.
Russell. Angelo. Skinny and the rest of the regulars.
FRANK V/O
Everybody approved of Ramsey
Clark. He didn’t bother anybody.
He even disapproved of wire-taps,
if you can imagine. We called
him Pamsey Clark.
Everyone lifts their glass.
EVERYONE
To Pamsey.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 76.
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - NIGHT
Jimmy paces in his cell.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy would’ve celebrated, too,
but now he was worried about Fitz
finally - Pro or no Pro - Bobby or
no Bobby - which that terrorist
took care of for good in the
kitchen of that hotel in Los
Angeles two months later.
INT. HOTEL KITCHEN - DAY
It’s chaotic in the kitchen, but not because of an
assassination. This isn’t the Ambassador - it’s a hotel
in Miami - and they’re cooking for hundreds of people.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy had reason to worry.
INT. BALLROOM - MIAMI HOTEL - DAY
Frank regards the ballroom while the hotel staff sets
out glasses, dish- and silverware and centerpieces on the
tables. There’s a big picture of Fitz on the stage.
FRANK V/O
The convention was coming up
again and this time there wasn’t a
single picture of him in the
convention hall - just one out in
the lobby in a corner.
INT. LOBBY - MIAMI HOTEL - DAY
Frank has a couple of hotel maintenance guys rescue the
poster of Jimmy from the lobby corner.
FRANK V/O
It was like Fitz’s people were
trying to erase him like this was
Russia.
INT. BALLROOM - MIAMI HOTEL - DAY
Now two posters flank the stage - one of Fitz, and the
other smaller one of Jimmy - as Jimmy’s wife speaks -
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 77.
JO
As he looks forward to his next
parole hearing Jimmy sends you his
good wishes and, God willing, will
see you all the next convention.
While there is enthusiastic applause from the membership,
Frank notes the rather fainter applause by Fitz.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - NIGHT
Frank sits alone with Russell at his usual table.
BUFALINO
How’s everyone at home?
FRANK
Good. How’s Carrie?
BUFALINO
Good. How’s Jimmy?
FRANK
Not good. He wants to get out.
BUFALINO
That’s understandable.
They dip bread in wine. Then -
BUFALINO
We need to talk about something
other than Jimmy for a minute. I
wonder if you could help out with
another matter.
EXT. COLUMBUS CIRCLE - DAY
An Italian-American Civil Rights League rally.
FRANK V/O
A few months before, Joey Gallo
got that nut from Harlem to kiss
Joe Colombo.
A black man walks up to Colombo, shoots him in front of
his wife and kids, and is shot by Colombo’s bodyguards.
FRANK V/O
No doubt he had someone’s
approval, but not like that, not
in front of the man’s family.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 78.
EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT
Crazy Joey climbs out of a car with his young wife and
his bodyguard, smiling and waving to photographers before
going into a nightclub.
BUFALINO V/O
Now this fresh kid’s running
around New York with show business
big shots getting himself in the
papers all the time.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - CONTINUED
BUFALINO
Not only that, he’s shaking down
a couple of restaurants in Little
Italy.
INT. NIGHTCLUB - NIGHT
Crazy Joey shares a table with other glamorous types.
FRANK V/O
Running around like you’re Errol
Flynn - okay. Kissing someone in
front of his family - not okay but
okay. Messing around with Little
Italy - that’s definitely out.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - DAY
A pile of guns on a coffee table.
FRANK V/O
For something like this you want
two guns: the one you intend to
use, and a backup.
Frank regards the guns while the man who gathered them -
red-haired John Francis - waits.
FRANK V/O
You want something with more
stopping power than a .22. A .32
or a .38.
He moves the .22’s and silencers aside.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 79.
FRANK V/O
You certainly don’t want a
silencer. You want noise to send
the witnesses running for cover.
He adds the .45’s to the other rejects.
FRANK V/O
But not as much noise as a .45
makes - which you could hear in a
patrol car blocks away.
EXT. NEW YORK - DAY
Little Italy on a normal spring day.
FRANK V/O
Normally, nothing like this
happens in Little Italy. It’s
bad for the tourist business if
tourists think it’s unsafe, and
people from Downtown make a lot
of money on the tourist business
here.
Downtown Guys sitting outside a social club.
FRANK V/O
Plus tourists don’t know how
to be good witnesses. They don’t
have the sense like normal people
to tell the cops it was eight
midgets who did it.
Tourists taking pictures on a corner.
FRANK V/O
But it would be late and the
tourists from Idaho would be in
bed by then, and the fact it was
Little Italy would relax Joey and
relaxed is what you want.
We - a POV - find and enter Umberto’s Clam House -
INT. UMBERTO’S CLAM HOUSE - DAY
The POV regards the interior - the two entrances on
Mulberry and Hester - the arrangement of tables - like
it’s making a diagram of the place.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 80.
FRANK V/O
It was his birthday, so he’d
probably be there with his wife
and other relatives - which, in
this case, was the point. Because
of the Colombo thing, they should
have to see what it’s like. His
bodyguard would be there, too.
A waiter comes past with plates of spaghetti with clam
sauce.
FRANK V/O
The place could be crowded or
not late at night. One good thing
about late is he’d have a couple
drinks in him and that would slow
him down a little.
The POV finds an empty table for four, reserved perhaps
for someone special.
FRANK V/O
There’s no way you could get
closer than fifteen feet before
someone reached for their piece.
Joey himself would be carrying,
although it would probably be in
the wife’s purse. The bodyguard’s
would be closer at hand, so you’d
want to deal with him first.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Frank’s daughter Peggy - late teens now - watches
unnoticed through a crack in the bathroom door as her
father slips a .32 and a .38 in the back of his waistband
and puts his jacket on.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
It’s late. The house is dark. As he’s leaving, Peggy
appears at the top of the stairs.
PEGGY
Where are you going?
FRANK
I have to go out. Go to bed.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 81.
INT/EXT. FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
Frank gets into John Francis’s car. Peggy watches from
a window.
EXT. LITTLE ITALY - NIGHT
Umberto’s Clam House is the only place open this late.
Crazy Joey’s Lincoln pulls up in front. He climbs out
and helps the other passengers out, the first being his
wife.
FRANK V/O
Umberto’s is on the corner of
Mulberry and Hester Street, so I’d
get out on Mott Street and walk
there and John Francis would drive
around the block a couple times.
John Francis pulls his car over. Frank gets out on the
corner of Mott and Hester Street and the car pulls away.
FRANK V/O
If I didn’t come out, he’d
leave. If I came out it was done
but he wouldn’t have seen anything
so he could never say anything
except he dropped me off on Mott
Street, which is nothing.
Frank walks toward Umberto’s Clam House.
FRANK V/O
Sometimes with something like
this you want to go to the
bathroom first. It gives you a
chance to make sure no one
followed you in. It also gives
you a chance to make sure there’s
nobody in the bathroom you have to
worry about. It also gives you a
chance to go to the bathroom. You
don’t want to be uncomfortable.
Frank opens the Mulberry Street door of Umberto’s -
FRANK V/O
But I went before and in a place
this small, this late, you may as
well just go right to work.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 82.
INT. UMBERTO’S CLAM HOUSE - CONTINUOUS
Frank steps inside. Walks toward the bar. Notes Crazy
Joey Gallo and his wife at a table with another couple, a
bodyguard - and a little girl who must be his daughter.
Before the bartender can ask Frank what he wants to
drink, he walks toward Gallo’s table and shoots the bodyguard
with the .38. Gallo’s wife and the other couple
dive for cover, pulling the girl down with them.
Gallo pushes away from the table to run. Frank shoots
him once from behind just as he reaches the door, twice
more on the sidewalk, then walks up the block just as
John Francis pulls around it. He gets in the car.
FRANK V/O
Naturally, the next thing you
want to do is get rid of the gun.
John Francis liked a place in
Yonkers.
EXT. YONKERS - LATER - NIGHT
Frank throws the gun into the Hudson while John Francis
waits in the car.
FRANK V/O
There’s a spot like this in
Schuylkoll River in Philly. If
they ever sent divers in they’d
find an underwater armory.
INT. COFFEE SHOP - OHIO - DAY - 1975
Frank washes his hands in the mens room.
FRANK V/O
It turns out the Gallo thing
was good for business. That’s the
irony. Right now I guarantee you
there’s a tour bus parked outside
Umberto’s and 27 tourists gawking
at the chair he was sitting in.
And they got to eat somewhere.
He comes out and past Russell on a pay phone. Frank
can’t be sure, but it seems Russell maybe stops talking
to whoever he’s talking to until Frank is out of earshot.
He joins his wife and Carrie at a table.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 83.
INT. PAROLE HEARING ROOM - DAY - 1973
Jimmy sits before the parole board, reading from a
prepared statement about how he will devote his life on
the outside to education.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy’s parole board hearing
didn’t go so well. For one thing
they weren’t any more pleased than
Tony Pro was about his one-pointseven
million dollar pension.
INT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY
Jimmy is escorted down the cell block by guards.
FRANK V/O
Luckily, all the money the
Teamsters threw at Nixon’s campaigns
over the years paid off.
EXT. LEWISBURG PENITENTIARY - DAY
Frank and Jimmy’s lawyers escort him past reporters and
photographers as he’s released.
FRANK V/O
Up to his ears in Watergate,
the President still found time to
pardon him and there was nothing
the parole board could say about
it.
EXT. LUMS - MIAMI - DAY
Frank waits at the pick-up counter of a hotdog stand.
A TV by the grill - like every TV in America - broadcasts
the Watergate hearings.
FRANK V/O
The first thing he did was go
down to Miami for a well-deserved
vacation. The first thing I did
was pick up some chili dogs for us
from Lums, which he loves almost
as much as ice cream.
Frank watches as his order is assembled.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 84.
FRANK V/O
The secret is they steam them in
beer. There’s not a better hotdog
in America.
INT. JIMMY’S CONDO - MIAMI - DAY
The Watergate hearings are on the TV here, too, but Frank
and Jimmy aren’t watching as they eat their chili dogs.
HOFFA
What am I going to do with Fitz?
He actually thinks he runs things.
I appointed him. Now he thinks
he’s somebody.
FRANK
He’s very popular Downtown.
HOFFA
Of course he is. He loans money
to anyone. If the banks did that -
can you imagine? - we’d have a
financial crisis. I need another
napkin.
Frank hands him some.
HOFFA
He’s not going to step down.
I have get him out of there in
an election - which I can do - I
just can’t believe I have to.
Frank nods, but his silence says something.
HOFFA
What.
FRANK
Like I said, he’s popular
Downtown.
HOFFA
Downtown doesn’t run this union.
FRANK
With Fitz, they do.
HOFFA
This cocksucker has fucked
everything up. Him and that other
cocksucker. That cocksucker is
campaigning for him.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 85.
FRANK
Because of his pension.
HOFFA
Because of his pension he doesn’t
deserve.
FRANK
He carries some weight, Pro. A
lot of votes.
HOFFA
I know.
Jimmy wipes at his shirt with a napkin.
HOFFA
Do I really have to make peace
with this cocksucker? I hate the
idea of that.
FRANK
Without him, Fitz would lose.
There’s no doubt.
Jimmy tries to picture sitting down with Pro, and it’s
enough to ruin his otherwise nice lunch.
HOFFA
If I sat down with him, would you
come along?
FRANK
Of course.
Jimmy glances away to the TV. John Dean is testifying,
his wife sitting stoically behind him.
HOFFA
That’s a good-looking broad,
that Mo Dean.
INT. PRIVATE CLUB - MIAMI - DAY
Frank and Jimmy sit at a table waiting. Jimmy checks his
watch. Looks at Frank.
HOFFA
Fuck it. Let’s go.
FRANK
Let’s give him a few more minutes.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 86.
HOFFA
This isn’t right. You don’t do
this. You don’t make a man wait.
FRANK
I know.
HOFFA
The only time you do is when?
When you want to say something.
When you want to say, Fuck you.
That’s the only time.
Frank nods. They wait. Finally, the door opens and
Tony Pro - wearing shorts and a polo shirt like he just
came from the pool - comes in with another man. They
join Jimmy and Frank at the table.
PRO
I just heard it’s eight degrees
back home. Can you believe that?
It’s what, seventy outside? Why
don’t we live here year-round is
what I want to know.
Jimmy doesn’t say anything. Regards Pro’s casual attire.
Eventually -
PRO
What.
HOFFA
You’re late.
PRO
There was traffic.
HOFFA
I’ve never been late for a meeting
in my life.
PRO
(to his cousin)
Wasn’t there traffic?
The cousin nods.
HOFFA
I’ve never waited for anyone
who’s late more than ten minutes.
PRO
I’d say fifteen. Fifteen is
right.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 87.
HOFFA
No. Ten.
PRO
I don’t think so. Ten is not
enough. You have to take traffic
into account.
HOFFA
That is taking traffic into
account. That’s why it’s ten.
PRO
I still say fifteen.
HOFFA
Ten.
PRO
Fine. We disagree on that.
I’m here. What can I do for you?
Jimmy can barely think straight as mad as he is about Pro
being late, but eventually collects himself.
HOFFA
I want to ask you for your
endorsement for -
PRO
Before you tell me, let’s get the
other thing straightened out.
HOFFA
I can’t do anything about your
pension. Not with Fitz in there.
With Fitz there, you should talk
to Fitz about it.
PRO
I did. He says he’ll take care
of it. No questions asked. You
wouldn’t do that, but he will. I
meant the other thing.
HOFFA
The other thing.
PRO
You know.
HOFFA
I don’t know.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 88.
PRO
Your apology.
HOFFA
My apology. For what.
PRO
For what you said when you were
sitting there eating your fucking
ice cream like some fucking king.
That was an ethnic slur - “you
people.”
Jimmy just looks at him. Then -
HOFFA
I’ll apologize for that - after
you apologize for being late - you
mother fucking wop cocksucker.
Now Pro just looks at Jimmy while Frank shakes his head
wearily. Eventually -
PRO
I’ll apologize for that - after I
kidnap your granddaughter, rip her
guts out and send them to you in
an envelope.
Jimmy goes for him. Frank and Pro’s cousin try to pull
them apart - like the guards did in the prison cafeteria -
but, just like then, it isn’t easy.
INT. CAR - MOVING - MIAMI - NIGHT
Frank drives Jimmy back to his condo after the disaster
with Pro. They drive in silence. Then -
HOFFA
You think Russell would do
something about the Little Guy?
FRANK
That would be complicated.
HOFFA
I know, but maybe you could talk
to him. Have a conversation. See
what he says. I’d appreciate it.
EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT
Frank and Russell climb out of Frank’s car.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 89.
FRANK V/O
There’s no way what Jimmy wanted
was going to happen. Russell, Pro
and Pro’s boss Tony Salerno were
all Genovese technically.
They head for the entrance of Vesuvius restaurant.
FRANK V/O
But maybe things could be
smoothed over without going that
far. Maybe calmer heads could get
together and prevail.
INT. VESUVIUS - NIGHT
Frank and Russell share a table with Tony Salerno.
SALERNO
I don’t approve of what Pro said
to Jimmy.
FRANK V/O
Now that Bobby Kennedy was long
gone and Eliot Richardson was all
tied up with Watergate, we could
speak English again wherever we
wanted.
SALERNO
But I’m not going to tell him
what he can say and what he can’t
say. Jimmy says things too he
shouldn’t sometimes.
BUFALINO
He’s very upset.
SALERNO
I’m sure he is. Who talks like
that about a man’s grandchildren?
But someone has to calm him down.
FRANK
I don’t know what to tell him to
calm him down.
SALERNO
I don’t know if it will calm him
down but you can tell him I always
liked him and I won’t stand in his
way.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 90.
EXT. GOLF COURSE - DAY
Fitz plays golf with the diminutive Tony Pro.
FRANK V/O
That didn’t calm him down. But
at least for a while he dealt with
Fitz instead of the Little Guy.
EXT. TEAMSTER OFFICES - DC - DAY
Jimmy, always a magnet for reporters, stands outside
what used to be his office building, giving a televised
interview.
HOFFA
This guy travels around the
country to every goddamn golf
tournament there is. He does this
and collects a full-time salary as
Teamster president. How do you do
that? There’s not enough hours in
a day. I went to prison for
fraud. This is fraud what he’s
doing.
EXT. MARINA - LAKE MICHIGAN - DAY
A man and his family walk along a dock carrying fishing
tackle and a cooler.
FRANK V/O
Fitz responded to Jimmy’s
criticism by asking Jimmy’s old
friend and ally Dave Johnson to
resign from Local 299 so Fitz’s
son Richard could take over.
As Dave Johnson and his wife and kids near his 45-foot
cabin cruiser, it suddenly blows up.
EXT. STREET - DETROIT - DAY
A man comes out of the Nemo Bar and walks toward his
white Lincoln Continental.
FRANK V/O
Jimmy responded by sending
a message back that Fitz’s son
Richard should be happy with
things the way they were.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 91.
Richard Fitzsimmon’s Lincoln blows up.
EXT. UNION HALL - DAY
Jo Hoffa puts a file box in the trunk of her car and
climbs in behind the wheel.
FRANK V/O
Fitz responded by suggesting to
Jimmy’s wife Josephine she might
be happier working somewhere else
and fired her from her union job,
which cost them forty-eight grand
a year.
Her hand shakes as she turns the key in the ignition,
but the car doesn’t blow up.
INT. NBC STUDIO - DAY
Jimmy is the guest on “Meet The Press.” A make-up girl
dabs moderator Lawrence Spivak’s face, but when she tries
to do the same for Jimmy, he waves her off.
FRANK V/O
The thing with Jo enraged Jimmy
so much he tried to discredit Fitz
for good by playing the highest
card in the deck. The organized
crime card.
Jimmy on-camera now, in the middle of the program -
HOFFA
Frank Fitzsimmons has sold this
union out to his underworld pals.
The mob controls him, which means
it controls our Pension Fund. I’m
talking about a billion dollars in
loans this man has given to known
racketeers for their illegal
enterprises.
FRANK V/O
This sort of thing got everyone’s
attention.
INT. VESUVIUS - NIGHT
Salerno, Russell and Frank again.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 92.
SALERNO
Is he serious?
BUFALINO
He doesn’t mean any of this.
SALERNO
Maybe he got religion in prison.
BUFALINO
He didn’t.
SALERNO
People do. Remember Whispers.
The other Whispers.
BUFALINO
He’s just doing what the
millionaire’s son did to him
because it worked.
SALERNO
I don’t know. When I hear a
thundering herd of hooves, I think
of horses, not zebras. Maybe he
means what he says.
BUFALINO
I don’t think he does.
SALERNO
Either way it’s not good. Someone
should tell him maybe he wants
to cash in that big pension and
spend more time with his
grandchildren.
FRANK
I don’t think he wants to do that.
SALERNO
He should think about it is all.
EXT. STREET - NIGHT
Frank walks along with Jimmy who is walking his dog.
HOFFA
Who said that?
FRANK
It doesn’t matter. It was said.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 93.
HOFFA
Was it Russell?
FRANK
No.
HOFFA
The Little Cocksucker from the
Miami Fiasco?
FRANK
No.
HOFFA
Who.
FRANK
The other Tony.
HOFFA
Which other Tony? They’re all
named Tony. What’s the matter
with Italians - they can only
think of one name.
FRANK
Salerno.
That Tony means something to Jimmy, but not enough
apparently, even after some reflection.
HOFFA
I’m not retiring. Someone can
tell him that.
Someone means Frank. He’s right in the middle of this
now. Jimmy cleans up after his dog.
HOFFA
How’s everything at home?
FRANK
Good.
HOFFA
That’s good. How’s everything in
Philly?
FRANK
Good.
HOFFA
That’s good.
Silence.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 94.
HOFFA
What’s wrong.
FRANK
Nothing. It’s not the right time.
HOFFA
What isn’t.
FRANK
107’s putting together a
testimonial dinner for me. I was
thinking of asking if you might
present the award.
HOFFA
Who’s going to be there?
FRANK
Everyone.
Jimmy doesn’t respond, wondering perhaps if he’d be safe
with “everyone” there.
FRANK
I understand.
HOFFA
No, I’ll be there. I don’t give
a fuck who’s there. You deserve
this. I’d be honored.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - NIGHT
We come past a poster on an easel that says, “Frank
Sheeran Appreciation Night,” and make our way into a
crowded ballroom.
FRANK V/O
Everyone was there.
Russell, Bruno, Tony Salerno and Tony Pro and their wives
at one table, and other guys from Downtown at others.
FRANK V/O
Even the mayor was there, Frank
Rizzo. And the head of the NAACP,
Cecil Moore. And the former D.A.,
Emmett Fitzpatrick.
They are on the dais with Frank and Jimmy. Just below
it at a table are Josephine Hoffa and Frank’s wife Irene
and his daughters.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 95.
FRANK V/O
John McCullough of the roofer’s
union put the tribute together and
he went all out.
Waiters move around the tables, serving dinner to two
thousand people.
FRANK V/O
Usually at these things, you get
chicken. If you’re lucky, maybe a
piece of meat. John arranged it
so you could have prime rib or
lobster. I had the prime rib and
it was excellent.
Skinny Razor stands at the head of a line where a
bartender in a tuxedo mixes him a drink.
FRANK V/O
And the bar was an open bar. And
not just beer and wine. You could
get any drink you wanted and not
pay for it.
Russell and Salerno regard Jimmy eating prime rib up on
the dais.
BUFALINO
Jimmy’s always been good to deal
with far as I’m concerned, and the
fact is there’s only so much money
they can loan and when that well’s
dry, it doesn’t matter who’s in
charge of it.
SALERNO
I’m not concerned about new
loans. He said to someone once
Fitz is out, he’s going to call in
old loans. Real estate, casinos,
whatever it is, you don’t pay,
he’s taking them over.
BUFALINO
He said that?
SALERNO
Who does he think he is, Castro?
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT
As dessert is served, a line of fishnet-stockinged
dancers high-kick on stage.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 96.
FRANK V/O
For entertainment John had the
Gold Digger Dancers, with those
legs that don’t quit. And later,
that Italian singer, Jerry Vale,
who always seems to be at these
things.
Russell has found a place he can speak to Jimmy in
confidence.
BUFALINO
I don’t understand why you’re
doing this. You don’t need the
money.
HOFFA
It’s not about money.
BUFALINO
Then I don’t understand what all
this talk is about.
HOFFA
It’s my union.
BUFALINO
I don’t know. It seems maybe it’s
about something else.
Nothing from Jimmy.
BUFALINO
Some people - not me - are a
little concerned. Some people -
not me - feel you - might be -
HOFFA
Might be what.
BUFALINO
Demonstrating a failure to show
appreciation.
HOFFA
I’m not showing appreciation?
BUFALINO
Some people - not me - might think
so.
HOFFA
I went to school for eight years.
I didn’t name one name.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 97.
(MORE)
BUFALINO
I know.
HOFFA
I had to sit there listening to
that whining cocksucker from New
Jersey when all I wanted to do was
eat my ice cream in peace.
BUFALINO
I know.
HOFFA
I’m not showing appreciation?
BUFALINO
According to some people - not me.
HOFFA
Fuck them.
Jimmy walks away. Frank watches from across the room
concerned.
FRANK V/O
One thing you don’t do is say no
to Russell. The other thing you
don’t do is walk away from him.
You wait for him to walk away.
You don’t walk away first.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT
Russell and Salerno watch Jimmy up at the podium,
finishing his presentation to Frank -
HOFFA
Frank has devoted his life to
this union. As a shop steward,
as an organizer, as a mediator -
he’s been tireless in his service
to the working men and women of
this state. He also holds a
record you may not know, which I
don’t think anyone will ever beat:
Most arrests on a picket line -
26 times in 24 hours.
The guests applaud and laugh.
HOFFA
I’ve known Frank a long time.
I respect him. I rely on him.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 98.
He is a union mHaOnF FtAo( ChOiNsT 'bDo)nes,
and he is my friend. I am
honored to present this award -
and this beautiful watch - to
Frank Sheeran.
Frank joins him at the podium as everyone applauds.
Jimmy puts a gold diamond-encrusted watch on his wrist,
pats him on the back, turns the microphone over to him.
FRANK
Thank you, Jimmy. Thank you all.
Thank you to my wife Irene, and my
lovely daughters for putting up
with me all these years. I know I
don’t deserve all this tonight.
But I have arthritis and I don’t
deserve that either -
Everyone laughs.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT
As Jerry Vale sings “Sorrento,” a photographer motions
Frank and Jimmy to stand together for a picture -
HOFFA
Look at all these people who came
out. I truly had no idea you were
this strong.
FRANK
It’s a free steak and an open bar.
HOFFA
No, they’re here for you.
The camera flashes.
PHOTOGRAPHER
One more.
HOFFA
I really do appreciate all the
support you’ve given me. I mean
it. It’s not just words. I’m
glad you’re on my side.
FRANK
It’s an honor.
The camera flashes again -
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 99.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT
Now Jerry Vale’s singing an Irish song as Frank and Irene
and other couples dance. Russell and Salerno are talking
at their table. Salerno, who doesn’t look happy, gets up
and leaves. The song ends and Russell gestures to Frank
he needs to talk to him. They find a private spot.
BUFALINO
I didn’t want to do this in front
of everybody.
He hands Frank a small jewelry box. Inside, Frank finds
a gold ring with an Italian coin on top.
BUFALINO
Only three people in the world
have one of these, and only one
of them is Irish. I have one.
Angelo. And now you.
FRANK
I don’t know what to say.
BUFALINO
Put it on. Let’s see if it fits.
Frank slips the ring on. It fits. Jerry Vale starts
another song.
BUFALINO
There’s one other thing. I’m
sorry to do this to you on your
special night but it can’t wait.
It just got out of hand with our
friend. You got to talk to him.
For his sake.
He’s looking at Jimmy dancing with Jo.
FRANK
I don’t know what else to tell him
I haven’t told him already.
BUFALINO
Tell him what it is.
Frank isn’t sure he heard right. Russell nods to
emphasize what he shouldn’t have to.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 100.
INT. THE LATIN CASINO - LATER - NIGHT
Alone in the men’s room, Frank and Jimmy wash their
hands.
FRANK
I just spoke to Russell. He just
spoke to Salerno.
HOFFA
Yeah?
FRANK
He means what he’s saying.
HOFFA
So do I. He can’t seem to get
that through his head.
Jimmy dries his hands on a towel. Notices how ashenfaced
Frank is.
HOFFA
Don’t look so concerned.
FRANK
I’m a little concerned.
HOFFA
Nothing’s going to happen to me.
I got more records and lists ready
to be mailed to the press than
that motherfucker can imagine. I
know things he doesn’t know I
know. He should be a little
concerned, not you.
FRANK
He is. He told Russell to tell me
to tell you what it is.
Jimmy looks at Frank like Frank looked at Russell when
he said it.
HOFFA
He said that?
Frank nods gravely. Someone else comes into the men’s
room. Jimmy drops the hand towel in the towel hamper and
leaves. Frank stays behind to wash his hands again ...
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 101.
INT. CADILLAC - MOVING - DAY - 1975
Frank and Russell in front, the women in back, as Frank
drives along the highway through Ohio.
FRANK V/O
The wedding was all well and
good, but the real point of our
trip to Detroit was a peace
mission.
EXT. GAS STATION - OHIO - DAY - 1975
An attendant checks the oil. The women are buying
cigarettes from a machine while Russell buys some candy.
Frank’s making a call in a phone booth.
FRANK
I’m with the old man. We’re
driving up. He hopes this thing
can be worked out.
HOFFA
What’d he say?
FRANK
He said let’s work this thing
out. Sit down after the wedding
and work it out.
HOFFA
I’m not going to the wedding.
Too many people I don’t like are
going to be there.
FRANK
We could do it at your place if
you want. At the lake.
HOFFA
At the lake, huh.
FRANK
Or anywhere.
HOFFA
From day one I wanted to work
this out.
FRANK
I know.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 102.
HOFFA
From day fucking one.
FRANK
I know.
HOFFA
Just you two, right? Not the
Little Guy.
FRANK
Of course the Little Guy. That’s
the point.
HOFFA
No. Just the three of us.
FRANK
The three of us defeats the
purpose.
HOFFA
I’m not sitting down with that
cocksucker.
FRANK
It’s time to sit down. Everybody
says so.
HOFFA
Not with him.
FRANK
You’re making me work hard.
HOFFA
Just us.
Jimmy hangs up. Frank lets himself out of the booth.
Russell comes up to him with a small paper bag.
BUFALINO
What’d he say?
FRANK
He’s thinking about it.
BUFALINO
That’s all right. That’s good.
You want a Snickers?
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - OHIO - DAY
They’re checking into another motel.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 103.
(MORE)
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - OHIO - LATER - DAY
Russell hangs up a phone, crosses a patio where Irene
and Carrie wade in the pool with swimming caps on, sits
with Frank at a patio table, sips a Diet Coke.
BUFALINO
Maybe you should give Jimmy
another call. See if he’s thought
about it.
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - OHIO - LATER - DAY
Frank speaks on the pay phone near the pool.
HOFFA
When are you getting in?
FRANK
Tomorrow morning.
HOFFA
Good. I changed my mind about
the other thing.
FRANK
You did?
HOFFA
I’m meeting with the Little Guy
tomorrow afternoon.
FRANK
With the Little Guy.
HOFFA
Tony Jack set it up.
FRANK
With the Little Guy. Where?
HOFFA
In public, where do you think.
The Red Fox. On Telegraph. You
know it?
FRANK
Tony Jack is Pro’s cousin.
HOFFA
They’re all fucking cousins,
what are you going to do. But
Jack’s okay.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 104.
HOFFA(CONT'D)
(MORE)
I talked with him several times
after the Fiasco in Miami.
FRANK
I’d feel better if I was there.
HOFFA
So would I, that’s why I asked
when you’re getting in.
FRANK
What time is the meeting?
HOFFA
2:30, and he better not be late.
FRANK
The Red Fox.
HOFFA
On Telegraph. I’ll be there at 2.
So you should be there at 2.
FRANK
I’ll be there at 2.
Frank hangs up, a little puzzled about Jimmy’s change of
heart. Walks back to the patio table.
BUFALINO
What’d he say?
FRANK
He’s going to meet with Pro.
BUFALINO
That’s good.
FRANK
Tony Jack arranged it.
BUFALINO
That’s good.
INT. MOTEL ROOM - HOWARD JOHNSONS - EVENING
Frank and Irene change out of their driving clothes into
something nicer for dinner, like people used to do.
FRANK V/O
Maybe Jimmy was setting up Pro.
Or maybe he was counting on Pro to
act like Pro so his cousin Tony
Jack could see it.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 105.
Or maybe this wFeRdAdNiKn gV /rOe(aClOlNyT 'wDa)s
bringing everyone together.
There’s a knock on the door. Russell and Carrie, dressed
nicely, too, now. As they all leave -
FRANK V/O
Whatever it was, you’d think
Russell would have asked when the
meeting was, whether he was
supposed to come or not.
Something.
The door closes. We remain in the empty room.
FRANK V/O
But he didn’t.
INT. ITALIAN RESTAURANT - OHIO - NIGHT
The two couples share the best table in the restaurant.
FRANK V/O
We ate that night at a little
Italian place Russell owned a
piece of.
A waiter deliver plates of food.
FRANK V/O
I had spaghetti marinara and
broccoli rabe - and afterwards -
like you do in Italy - some salad
- with dressing Russell made
himself in the back.
INT. RESTAURANT KITCHEN - LATER - NIGHT
Frank watches Russell prepare his special salad dressing
in the restaurant’s kitchen.
BUFALINO
You got to start with good olive
oil. If you don’t have that don’t
bother.
He pours about a cup of olive oil in a mason jar.
BUFALINO
Same with the balsalmic. If
it’s not aged at least ten years,
forget it, you may as well eat
Wishbone.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 106.
He pours some thick black balsalmic vinegar in the jar.
BUFALINO
By the way, we got a little
change in plans. We’re going to
hang around here tomorrow morning
and drive up in the afternoon.
Frank doesn’t say anything as Russell adds salt and
pepper to the mason jar. Eventually -
FRANK
I told Jimmy we’d be there in
the morning.
BUFALINO
I know.
Russell holds something up that looks like his own
gnarled hand.
BUFALINO
You know what this is? Ginger
root. This is the secret to good
dressing.
Frank isn’t thinking about salad dressing; he’s still
reeling from Russell telling him he’s not going to let
him be with Jimmy at the meeting with Pro. As Russell
chops up some ginger room and puts it in the jar -
BUFALINO
We did all we could for him.
But he made one too many threats.
It’s clear he intends to eat
alone. It’s what it is.
Russell looks to Frank for a nod that he understands,
but Frank doesn’t nod. Russell swirls the mixture in the
jar around like a snifter of brandy and dips a finger in
to taste it.
BUFALINO
Frank?
FRANK
What.
BUFALINO
Don’t call him.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 107.
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS MOTEL ROOM OHIO - LATER - NIGHT
Frank lies awake in bed next to his sleeping wife. The
phone rests on the night stand next to him.
INT. HOWARD JOHNSONS - OHIO - MORNING
Frank comes down to the breakfast room. Russell is the
only other guest there this early, filling a plastic bowl
with cornflakes.
BUFALINO
Morning.
FRANK
Good morning.
BUFALINO
How’d you sleep?
FRANK
Fine.
BUFALINO
Want some Total?
FRANK
Okay.
Russell prepares him a bowlful.
BUFALINO
We’re going up to Port Clinton
today.
FRANK
I thought we were staying here.
BUFALINO
The women are staying here. We
won’t be gone long. Three hours
tops.
They sit with their cornflakes. Russell eats his. Frank
lets his get soggy.
FRANK
What’s in Port Clinton?
BUFALINO
A plane.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 108.
FRANK
A plane.
(Russell nods)
To where?
BUFALINO
Detroit.
This isn’t making any sense to Frank.
FRANK
We’re going to Detroit now?
BUFALINO
You’re going to Detroit now.
Then you’re coming back. Then
we’ll take our time driving up.
Nice leisurely drive.
Frank has no idea what he’s talking about, but doesn’t
like it, whatever it is.
BUFALINO
I got to put you into the thing,
Frank. Otherwise you’d never let
it happen, and it’s gonna happen.
Russell looks at Frank with the fondness of a father to
a son.
BUFALINO
I got to do this for your sake.
Russell eats his cornflakes. Frank only stirs his.
INT. CADILLAC - MOVING - HIGHWAY 80 - OHIO - DAY
As Frank drives, Russell sits in the passenger seat
looking out at the scenery.
FRANK V/O
I had to be in it. I knew too
much already not to be. Either
way Jimmy would be gone, but this
way what could I ever say against
anyone? Nothing. This way - and
it was only out of respect for
Russell the others had agreed -
I’d be safe.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 109.
EXT. AIRSTRIP - PORT CLINTON - OHIO - DAY
They drive onto a grass airstrip on the edge of Lake Erie
where a small plane waits. Frank parks and gets out.
Russell stays in the car.
FRANK V/O
And so would Irene. All she and
Carrie knew - and could ever say -
is we took the Caddy for a couple
hours to run some errands while
they ate lunch and smoked
cigarettes at the motel coffee
shop, and then we were back.
Frank climbs the steps of the plane and sits in one of
its six seats. The pilot closes the door without looking
at him and returns to the cockpit. As the plane begins
to taxi, Frank looks out the window at the Cadillac.
EXT. MICHIGAN - DAY
The plane descends over the northwest shores of Lake
Erie. Lands on the Pontiac Airfield. The pilot lowers
the steps and Frank climbs out and walks to a parked Ford
that’s empty. He gets in, finds keys under the mat,
starts it up.
INT/EXT. FORD - PONTIAC, MICHIGAN - MOVING - DAY
Frank drives along Telegraph Road. Opens the glove
compartment, notes the little .22 in it, closes it, sees
the Red Fox restaurant up ahead, checks his watch.
FRANK V/O
I couldn’t see him, but it was
two o’clock, so he was there, and
he’d be expecting me no later than
five after. Jimmy knew Pro had no
respect for punctuality, but he
knew I did.
Frank drives past the Red Fox and makes a left onto Seven
Mile Road.
EXT. PONTIAC, MICHIGAN - DAY
Frank drives across a railroad bridge. Then down a
residential street with old modest houses on acre lots.
Checks an address scribbled on a torn piece of newspaper.
Pulls over and regards a house with brown shingles.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 110.
FRANK V/O
Everything was close to everything
else. The airstrip. The
restaurant. The house. And where
he’d go after that.
Frank notes a Buick parked at the end of a single-lane
driveway running alongside the house.
FRANK V/O
Some people said that was in a 55-
gallon drum that ended up in a New
Jersey dump. Or in the end zone
of Giants stadium, under the
grass.
Frank opens the glove box and takes out the .22. Gets
out of the car, shoving the pistol in his back waist band
under his jacket.
FRANK V/O
These people never had a body
on their hands. You don’t want to
drive one more mile than you have
to if you can help it.
He climbs the brick steps of the brown-shingled house
and opens the unlocked front door -
INT. HOUSE - PONTIAC - CONTINUOUS
A man on his hands and knees looks up at Frank through
Coke-bottle glasses.
SALLY BUGS
Hi, Frank.
Sally has a matte-knife in his hand and uses it to cut
some linoleum he’s laying out on top of the wood floor of
the entry.
Frank ignores him. Surveys the entry. Then walks into
the adjacent living room, glimpsing as he goes two young
Italian guys in the kitchen playing cards. Sally Bugs
comes in, parts the blinds and looks out.
SALLY BUGS
Chuckie’s late.
FRANK V/O
Chuckie was Jimmy’s foster son.
He was in the thing too but didn’t
know it.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 111.
Sally Bugs sees a car pulling to the curb.
SALLY BUGS
Is that him?
A Mercury pulls in with just the driver in it, a guy
wearing a wide-collared paisley shirt and gold chains
like he’s in Saturday Night Fever. Frank nods.
FRANK V/O
All Chuckie knew, he was picking
up one of Pro’s guys - Sally, who
he didn’t know - and me - who he
did know - and we were all picking
up his dad at the Red Fox for a
meeting. He was in it, as you
say, stupidly.
EXT. HOUSE - PONTIAC - MOMENTS LATER
Frank and Sally Bugs come out of the house and approach
the Mercury.
FRANK V/O
I felt sorry for Chuckie. If
anyone deserves to be forgiven,
it’s him.
SALLY BUGS
I’m Sally.
CHUCKIE
Hi. Hi, Frank.
FRANK
Chuckie.
SALLY BUGS
Let’s go. I don’t want your
father yelling at me for being
late. You can sit in front,
Frank.
Frank isn’t sure he wants to sit in front. Sally Bugs,
we may remember, strangled that poor Teamster Secretary-
Treasurer in the front seat. But Sally already has the
car’s back door open and is sliding in.
SALLY BUGS
What the fuck is this?
CHUCKIE
What.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 112.
SALLY BUGS
It’s wet back here.
CHUCKIE
I had a frozen fish I had to drop
off to someone.
SALLY BUGS
A fish? The seat is wet from a
fish?
CHUCKIE
Sorry.
Sally Bugs lays his handkerchief on the seat and sits on
it. Frank climbs into the front passenger seat.
INT. MERCURY - MOVING - DAY
Chuckie makes a right off Seven Mile Road onto Telegraph.
SALLY BUGS
What kind of fish?
CHUCKIE
I don’t know. A fish. To eat.
SALLY BUGS
You don’t know what kind?
CHUCKIE
No.
SALLY BUGS
Where’d you get it?
CHUCKIE
At a fish place.
Frank checks his watch. It’s 2:40.
EXT. RED FOX RESTAURANT - DAY
They pull into the parking lot as Jimmy is coming out of
the restaurant. Chuckie taps the horn and waves. Jimmy
regards the Mercury a moment, then comes over to it.
CHUCKIE
Sorry I’m late.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 113.
HOFFA
You’re late? What the fuck are
you even doing here? Who invited
you?
SALLY BUGS
Hi, Jimmy.
HOFFA
Who the fuck are you?
SALLY BUGS
I’m with Tony.
HOFFA
You’re with Tony. You’re with
this cocksucker who’s late again?
I’m not waiting for this cocksucker
again. He was supposed to
be here at 2:30. It’s 2:40. I
don’t wait for anyone more than
ten minutes. Mother fucking
cocksucker.
SALLY BUGS
He’s at the house.
HOFFA
What house?
SALLY BUGS
He’s with Russ.
HOFFA
He’s with Russ? What the fuck’s
going on here?
SALLY BUGS
Look who’s here.
Jimmy leans down to see who’s in the passenger seat.
FRANK
Hi, Jimmy.
HOFFA
Frank. Where were you? You
were supposed to be here at two.
What is this?
FRANK
Russell decided to come. But not
here. He doesn’t know the place.
It’s not comfortable for him.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 114.
HOFFA
Russell’s here?
Frank nods. Jimmy relaxes a little.
SALLY BUGS
Get in. We’ll bring you back
after to get your car.
Sally Bugs pushes open the back door for Jimmy to get in
and the image freezes -
FRANK V/O
No way in a million years Jimmy
would ever get in a car with one
of Pro’s guys in it ... unless I
was in it, too. Which is why I
was in it. I made it safe.
The image unfreezes: Sally Bugs taps the seat next to
him.
SALLY BUGS
There was a fish in here, but I
cleaned it up.
HOFFA
What?
SALLY BUGS
Chuckie had a fuckin fish in
here, he doesn’t even know what
kind, but it’s okay now, I wiped
it up.
HOFFA
You put a fish in here? In your
car?
CHUCKIE
For Bobby Holmes. Bobby likes
fish.
SALLY BUGS
I cleaned it up. It’s all right.
Jimmy looks at Frank again as if to ask, Is it all right?
Frank nods. Jimmy gets into the back seat next to Sally.
HOFFA
Chuckie, never put a fish in your
car. Unless it’s wrapped up good.
CHUCKIE
I know.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 115.
The Mercury pulls out of the lot.
INT. CHUCKIE’S MERCURY - MOVING - DAY
The Mercury drives the same route Frank took earlier.
HOFFA
Frank. You couldn’t come by at
2:00 and tell me this? I had to
wait there forty minutes like a
moron?
FRANK
I came as soon as I got in.
HOFFA
You got in this morning.
FRANK
I didn’t. Russell had some
business in Port Clinton this
morning.
HOFFA
This morning. Okay. But it’s
this afternoon. All due respect
to Russ but no one could come over
at 2:00 and tell me it was 2:30?
At the very least?
FRANK
I’m sorry. I apologize.
HOFFA
(like Sally’s not there)
And who the fuck is Pro sending a
fucking errand boy.
FRANK
Sally’s not staying.
HOFFA
That’s right he’s not staying.
But Pro sent him is the point when
he should’ve come picked me up
himself.
(to Sally)
Can you even see out those
glasses?
SALLY BUGS
I can see, Jimmy.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 116.
EXT. HOUSE - PONTIAC - CONTINUOUS
The Mercury pulls into the driveway behind the Buick and
the Ford and idles. Jimmy and Frank get out. Sally Bugs
comes around and gets into the passenger seat.
As Chuckie backs the car out, Jimmy and Frank head for
the house. Jimmy - as he always does with whoever he’s
with - walks ahead.
HOFFA
You got your friend with you?
Glancing back, he sees Frank touch the small of his back.
HOFFA
Good. You never know with this
cocksucker, with or without Russ
there.
He opens the front door -
INT. HOUSE - PONTIAC - CONTINUOUS
As soon as he’s inside, Jimmy knows there’s a problem.
He should hear voices - but it’s quiet. And there’s no
one in the living room, which he can see from here. And
there’s this badly-cut piece of linoleum under his feet.
FRANK V/O
He knew right away what it was.
FIVE QUICK VIGNETTES:
Tony Pro playing Greek rummy with some guys at his union
hall in New Jersey -
Tony Salerno watching a soccer game on a TV -
Fitz on a golf course chipping a ball out of a sand trap -
Russell napping in the back of Frank’s Cadillac parked on
the Port Clinton airstrip -
Irene Sheeran and Carrie Bufalino smoking cigarettes in
the motel coffee shop -
FRANK V/O
Just not my part of it.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 117.
BACK TO THE HOUSE -
HOFFA
Let’s get out of here, Frank.
As Jimmy bumps past Frank to leave, grasping the knob of
the door Frank just closed, Frank shoots him twice behind
his right ear.
He slumps to the floor. Blood runs onto the temporary
linoleum. Frank tries to open the door, but Jimmy’s body
is against it. He gently tugs Jimmy away from it, gets
it open, sets the .22 on Jimmy, walks out and closes the
door.
EXT. PORT CLINTON - LATER - DAY
The plane taxies to a stop on the airstrip. The pilot,
careful not to look at Frank, lowers the steps for him.
He comes down them and crosses to the Cadillac, where
Russell is napping.
Frank climbs in and starts it up. Russell wakes as the
car pulls out. Just by looking at Frank, he can tell the
little errand in Detroit has been taken care of.
BUFALINO
Anyway, I hope you had a pleasant
flight.
FRANK
I hope you had a good sleep.
And that’s it. They drive in silence.
INT. CHURCH - DETROIT - NEXT DAY
Jimmy’s lawyer’s daughter comes down the aisle on the
arm of her father. The church is packed, and a lot of
them are wiping at tears with Kleenex.
Frank doesn’t have Kleenex, and wouldn’t use it if he
did. He quickly wipes at his eyes with the back of his
hand.
His daughter Peggy glances at him curiously. Russell
glances over less curiously as Frank looks down at the
gold ring he gave him and the watch Jimmy gave him.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 118.
INT. CAR - MOVING - NIGHT - 1999
The wedding march is swallowed up by the roar of trucks
on the highway. Sitting in the passenger seat, Frank has
the same expression of grief and remorse on his face, but
he’s twenty-some years older. He looks out the window as
the car he’s in passes the Howard Johnsons.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - PHILADELPHIA - DAY - 1975
A TV broadcasts a news report on Hoffa’s disappearance.
He’s been missing a couple days now. Frank comes in from
outside, takes his coat off, regards the TV and his wife
and daughters who are watching it.
FRANK
Still no word?
Irene shakes her head no. Frank pours himself a drink.
FRANK
I should call Jo.
IRENE
You haven’t called her yet?
FRANK
I’m calling her now.
Irene turns back to the TV report. Peggy doesn’t. She
studies her father ...
FRANK V/O
I’m not sure what it was. Maybe
I looked hard, instead of worried.
Or that I should have been rushing
out to hurt somebody, and wasn’t.
Whatever it was, it was wrong, and
just by looking at me, she knew.
Peggy watches her father turn and head upstairs.
FRANK V/0
She stopped talking to me that
day. August 3rd, 1975. She has a
good job and lives outside Philly
now - but my daughter Peggy
disappeared from my life that day.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 119.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - LATER - NIGHT
Alone in his bedroom, Frank sits on the edge of his bed
dialing a phone. He can hear the report from downstairs
faintly up here as people who know nothing theorize about
the disappearance. The call connects.
FRANK
Jo? It’s Frank.
(pause)
Whatever you need, anything I can
do, I’m here.
She’s crying now. He puts the receiver to his head like
it’s a gun ... then back to his ear.
FRANK
It’s gonna be all right. I’m
sure he’s all right.
EXT. FUNERAL PARLOR - NIGHT
The two Italians who were playing cards in the kitchen
lift a body in a black garbage bag from the trunk of the
Buick.
FRANK V/O
Not that it was any of my
business, but Russell told me
later they cremated Jimmy at a
funeral parlor a mile from the
house.
They carry it to the back door of the funeral parlor.
FRANK V/O
They put him in a box and fired up
the oven.
INT. FUNERAL PARLOR - NIGHT
A pine coffin burns in a cremation oven.
FRANK V/O
The oven burns so hot it melts
everything - bones, teeth, watch,
rings - but leaves the shape of
the body, like Pompeii.
The cinders of the coffin fall away to reveal an ashy
body. It comes out and someone pokes at it, dissolving
it to ashes.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 120.
FRANK V/O
It was no more complicated than
that.
INT. GRAND JURY ROOM - DAY
The father of the bride from the wedding, attorney Bill
Bufalino, sits at the defense table. His client - Frank -
is being question by a D.A.
FRANK V/O
Everyone who ever had anything
to do with Jimmy was hauled in and
questioned. And everyone took the
Fifth, which is what you do.
FRANK
On the advice of counsel, I
respectfully decline to answer
that question under the protection
afforded me by the Constitution.
D.A.
Let me ask you this: What color
is my pen?
FRANK
On the advice of counsel, I
respectfully decline to -
INT. COURTHOUSE - DAY
Frank and his lawyer head for the back exit.
FRANK V/O
Still, everyone got indicted
and convicted for one thing or
another, just not for that. No
one, as you know, even went to
jail for that. And no one talked.
Which is unusual since usually
three people can keep a secret
only when two are dead.
EXT. THE HOUSE IN PONTIAC - DAY - FLASHBACK
The two Italians playing cards in the kitchen -
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 121.
FRANK V/O
The Andretta brothers got twenty
years for squeezing cash out of a
trucking company in exchange for
labor peace.
INT. PRISON - DAY
Tony Pro walks down a cell block with other inmates -
FRANK V/O
Pro was convicted with them, but
he was already back in school for
that other thing I mentioned
before -
INT. CAR - MOVING - DAY - FLASHBACK
The man in the passenger seat finds the radio station he
wants and sits back.
FRANK V/O
That poor Secretary-Treasurer
who got more votes than Pro, which
they finally got him on.
As the nylon rope loops around the guy’s neck to strangle
him, Coke bottle glasses on a face come into frame.
FRANK V/O
Sally Bugs, you recall, did that
one.
EXT. FEDERAL BUILDING - DAY
From very far away, someone watches Sally Bugs walk from
his car to the building.
FRANK V/O
Sally was seen going into a
federal building. This by itself
isn’t a crime. Everyone has to do
that sometimes. But Sally - who
knows better - didn’t tell anybody
about it - which you must always
do. When you don’t, it can only
mean one thing: You’re not going
there for tea.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 122.
EXT. NEW YORK - NIGHT
Sally comes out of the Andrea Doria Social Club.
FRANK V/O
I suppose there’s a chance it
wasn’t that. But when in doubt,
have no doubt.
Frank and John Francis walk up to him.
FRANK
Hi, Sal.
SALLY BUGS
Hi, Frank.
Sally looks at John Francis, who he doesn’t know. As
he waits for an introduction, Frank shoots him twice in
the head - one of the bullets coming out shattering a
lens of his thick glasses.
FRANK V/O
Sally was dead by the time he
hit the ground, but to discourage
anyone with an idea to look out
their window after two shots, John
gave him three more.
John Francis pumps three shots into Sally’s body.
INT. OPERATING ROOM - DAY
Tony Salerno on a surgical table getting a colonoscopy.
FRANK V/O
Tony Salerno they got on an
income tax thing. The same week,
he was diagnosed with cancer.
INT. VILLA D’ROMA - DAY
Russell has what seems to be a very cordial conversation
with another man at his table.
FRANK V/O
Russell got hooked threatening to
strangle Jack Napoli over 25,000
dollars worth of jewelry he took
on credit and never paid for.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 123.
BUFALINO
It’s what it is, Jack.
EXT. VILLA D’ROMA - DAY
Russell is escorted out of the restaurant by federal
agents.
FRANK V/O
Napoli was rigged. They had it
on tape. They called it extortion
even though it was Napoli who was
clearly in the wrong.
INT. CAR WASH - DAY
Frank’s car inches through a car wash covered in suds.
FRANK V/O
They got me for my Cadillac.
I bought it from Eugene Boffa who
leased truck drivers to freight
companies and paid them
substandard wages, skimming the
difference.
Frank peers through soapy windows of the car wash at
his Cadillac as leather tongues from the ceiling shimmy
and sway and push the suds around.
FRANK V/O
They said I paid under-market
value for the car, and I had no
receipts to prove otherwise. They
said the car was a bribe to let
Boffa continue to pay his nonunion
wages.
Frank watches the Cadillac as spray-hoses rinse it and
the dryer blowers switch on.
FRANK V/O
I loved that car, but it wasn’t
worth the eighteen years they gave
me for it.
EXT. SANDSTONE PRISON - DAY
A remote prison set down amidst bare trees.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 124.
FRANK V/O
We all went to Sandstone,
Minnesota, which is no Lewisburg.
It’s up by the Canadian border,
where it’s colder than Philly, New
York and Chicago put together.
EXT. SANDSTONE PRISON - DAY
Bundled up against the cold, Russell, Salerno and some
other old inmates in wheelchairs roll bocce balls across
snow-patched ground. Frank, who’s getting no younger
himself, watches from the sidelines.
FRANK V/O
Russell got Parkinson’s there.
Tony Salerno couldn’t control his
urine anymore. The arthritis in
my hands moved to my back, and
neuropathy was in my feet. I
couldn’t feel either one of them.
Neurontin helped a little but it
also makes you dingy. If you take
it at night, okay, but during the
day it makes you forgetful. We
were all falling apart and the
freezing fucking cold wasn’t
helping.
INT. SANDSTONE CAFETERIA - DAY
Frank comes in with a paper bag, shuffles across the
cafeteria.
FRANK V/O
I needed a cane, but they won’t
give you a cane in prison, since
you could use it as a weapon.
He sits with Russell.
BUFALINO
You got it?
Frank nods. Takes prosciutto bread out of the bag and
begins breaking it into pieces. Eventually -
BUFALINO
Jimmy was a nice man. Nice
family. I didn’t want it to go
that far.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 125.
FRANK
I know.
Frank pours two glasses of grape juice.
BUFALINO
I should have protected you some
other way. I can’t forgive myself
for what I did to you.
FRANK
It’s all right.
Russell regards his shaking hand as he tries to steady it
enough to dip a piece of bread in the juice.
BUFALINO
Is this my punishment?
EXT. SANDSTONE PRISON - DAY
Frank waits for Russell on the so-called bocce court
with other old inmates. Spots him in his wheelchair as
it’s pushed by another inmate the other way.
FRANK
Where you going?
BUFALINO
To church.
FRANK
To church?
BUFALINO
Don’t laugh. You’ll go, too,
when the time comes.
Frank watches Russell as his wheelchair rolls along the
frozen earth.
FRANK V/O
Russell went to church. Then
he went to the prison hospital in
Springfield. Then he went to the
graveyard.
EXT. GRAVEYARD - DAY
The number of people in attendance seems too small for
someone of Russell’s stature.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 126.
FRANK V/O
I got out that October. Irene
died in December. December 17th.
Lung cancer. No surprise.
Frank stands at his wife’s grave with three of his
grown daughters, supporting himself on aluminum canes
like a polio victim. Peggy is there, but stands apart
from her sisters and father. He looks at her, but she
won’t look at him.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - DAY
Frank moves around the house on his canes, emptying
ashtrays of butts with lipstick marks on the filters.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
He sits in a chair in front of a TV he’s not watching,
drinking alone.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - ANOTHER DAY
He fills a plastic container marked with the days of the
week on it with dozens of pills, gets confused and starts
over.
INT. FRANK’S HOUSE - NIGHT
He comes past in his pajamas, negotiating a dark hallway
on his canes. Trips and falls and can’t get up.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - DAY
Elderly men and women dot a rec room like checkers on
an abandoned board. Some sit at games - dominos, cards,
Candyland - others regard a television with the sound
turned down too low for them to hear.
Frank sits apart from them in a wheelchair, the gold
watch on his wrist, the gold ring on his finger, his eyes
hidden behind aviator sunglasses. He’s been here for
months.
INT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - ANOTHER DAY
Frank sits in his wheelchair in his room. There’s a
small framed photograph in his lap. A nurse comes in to
take his vitals. As she does -
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 127.
FRANK
This is my daughter Peggy.
It’s the snapshot of Peggy and Jimmy at the miniature
golf course. The nurse gives it a perfunctory glance.
NURSE
Is it. I don’t think I’ve met
her.
FRANK
She hasn’t been around much.
NURSE
She’s your only child?
FRANK
I have four daughters.
NURSE
Really.
Frank nods. None of them have been around much.
NURSE
Who’s that with her?
FRANK
Who’s that?
NURSE
Relative?
FRANK
That’s Jimmy Hoffa.
NURSE
Oh.
She clearly doesn’t know who that is. Frank doesn’t
bother telling her.
EXT. ASSISTED LIVING FACILITY - ANOTHER DAY
Frank sits with two young FBI men in the courtyard.
He actually seems pleased to have them here. At least
they’re visitors.
FRANK
I’m sorry but I have to direct
you to my attorney Mr. Ragano if
you want to talk about Mr. Hoffa -
or any other matter for that
matter. I got nothing new to say.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 128.
FBI AGENT
He’s dead.
FRANK
Who’s dead?
FBI AGENT
Your attorney, Mr. Ragano.
FRANK
He’s dead? Who did it?
FBI AGENT
Cancer.
Frank didn’t know.
FBI AGENT
Everybody’s dead, Mr. Sheeran.
But Mr. Hoffa’s children aren’t.
They live with not knowing, and
that’s hard to do.
Frank actually seems like he might be thinking about
talking to them. But then -
FRANK
You seem like nice fellas. And
I appreciate you coming to see me.
But I can’t help you.
EXT. BANK - OUTSIDE PHILLY - DAY
An orderly tries to assist Frank as he struggles out of
a taxi with his canes.
FRANK
I got it. I’m fine. You stay
here.
INT. BANK - DAY
He comes in on his canes. Stands in a short line.
Looks around like he’s casing the place. Makes it to
the front, but lets someone go ahead of him so he can
wait for a particular window.
The customer there leaves and he hobbles toward it.
The teller - his daughter Peggy - sees him coming and
puts her “closed” sign up before he gets there.
FRANK
Peggy, don’t.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 129.
(MORE)
She’s walking away from the counter toward the back.
FRANK
I just want to talk to you.
Peggy. I’m dying.
Peggy goes through a door and closes it. The other
customers look at Frank.
EXT. HOUSE - PHILLY - DAY
The taxi, parked outside a small house.
INT. HOUSE - PHILLY - DAY
Frank sits with one of his other daughters - Delores.
DELORES
What do you want me to do?
FRANK
Call her. Tell her I want to talk
to her.
DELORES
Talk to her and tell her what?
FRANK
I want to tell her I’m sorry.
DELORES
For?
FRANK
I know I wasn’t such a good
father. I tried to be. I tried
to protect her. All of you.
DELORES
From what?
Now that he thinks about it, he’s not sure what.
DELORES
You have no idea what it was
like for us. We couldn’t come to
you with a problem because of the
horrible things you’d do to fix it
for us. You thought you were
protecting us, but it was the
opposite. We didn’t get protected
because we were too afraid to go
to you for protection.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 130.
We were protectDeEdL OfRrEoSm( CnOoNtTh'iDn)g, or
anyone, ever. You have no idea
the things people did to us.
FRANK
What did they do to you?
DELORES
Why. What are you going to do
about it? You can’t even walk.
Delores regards him a moment. Then -
DELORES
You weren’t a bad father ... you
were a nightmare.
INT. CASKET STORE - ANOTHER DAY
They build them and sell them here. It’s more like a
workshop inside a warehouse. The salesman used to be a
rock and roll promoter, but now he does this. He wears a
porkpie hat.
SALESMAN
I could tell you something else
but I’ll tell you the truth: It
makes no sense going with anything
more expensive than particle board
for cremation. Will it be
cremation? Or burial?
FRANK
Burial.
Frank surveys the rows of caskets from his wheelchair,
the orderly by his side.
SALESMAN
Is it for a man or a woman?
FRANK
It’s for me.
INT. HOSPITAL ROOM - DAY
Frank is in a hospital room, in his wheelchair, hooked
up to IVs, looking through some unframed photographs
someone has brought over.
The image of his face suddenly changes from film to
video as a camera is switched on. He seems out of it.
Morphine or Dilaudid for all the pain.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 131.
VOICE
You saw the monsignor.
Frank slowly runs a hand through his hair, guided by
the morphine.
VOICE
What’d you tell him?
FRANK
I told him it’s been 60 years
since my last confession.
VOICE
What’d he say to that?
FRANK
He said that’s okay.
VOICE
What else you tell him?
FRANK
That’s between me and him.
VOICE
Come on, Frank.
FRANK
I told him I’ve done some things
I’m not proud of.
VOICE
You told him what those things
are.
FRANK
He doesn’t need details. You
don’t have to tell him everything
to get absolution. It’s not
required.
VOICE
So you got what you needed from
him.
FRANK
I’m at peace.
The video camera tilts down to the photos on Frank’s lap -
there’s one of Russell and Frank on top - then back up to
his face.
VOICE
Are you?
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 132.
Frank looks up at the camera with that look of quiet
menace we saw before.
FRANK
You’re not being clever. You
think you are, but you’re not. Be
satisfied. You got enough. Don’t
be probing.
VOICE
You didn’t tell him about the
house.
FRANK
I didn’t have to tell him about
the house. You’re not listening.
You don’t have to say everything.
VOICE
You do.
FRANK
You don’t. I just told you.
VOICE
No, you do. You. It’s the last
thing you got to do.
Frank knows he’s right, but won’t admit it. The
camera keeps shooting as he leafs through the photos.
Eventually -
FRANK
I know what I got to do. I’m not
stupid. I got to say it. I don’t
have a fuckin chance after this if
I don’t. I die and ... I know
what I got to do.
He looks up at the camera.
FRANK
Ask me the question.
VOICE
Do you stand by what you’ve told
me?
FRANK
Yeah.
VOICE
Everything.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 133.
FRANK
Yeah.
VOICE
The war.
FRANK
Yeah.
VOICE
Whispers, the jeweler, Gallo.
FRANK
Yeah.
VOICE
Sally.
FRANK
They deserved it, all of them.
I got no remorse.
VOICE
And none for their families?
FRANK
I didn’t know their families.
VOICE
You knew Jimmy’s.
Silence as the camera keeps taping him. Tilts down to
the photo that’s now on top in his hands - Appreciation
Night - Jimmy and Frank - then back up to his face.
FRANK
Did I have any choice?
VOICE
I don’t know. Did you?
FRANK
If I’d refused, someone else
would have done it, and I’d have
been dead, too.
VOICE
You sure about that?
It kills Frank to keep looking at the photograph but he
forces himself to for several more moments before looking
back up at the camera. The anguish shows.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 134.
FRANK
What kind of a man does what I
did to a friend?
Silence as the video camera unmercifully records his
face, his guilt and remorse. The morphine doesn’t dull
that. Eventually -
VOICE
Frank. Whatever happens now
happens, but you stand a slightly
better chance now.
FRANK
(to himself)
E nelle mani di Dio. Like Russell
used to say.
VOICE
It’s in God’s hands.
Frank nods. The morphine takes his hand and slowly
combs it through his hair again. The camera shuts off,
and the image of his face switches from video back to
film. He watches as the guy with the video camera - who
we still don’t see - gathers his stuff.
FRANK
Don’t forget.
VOICE
I know. Leave the door open a
little.
Frank nods. His eyes follow the figure as he heads out.
VOICE
I’ll come visit you around
Christmas.
FRANK
When’s Christmas?
VOICE
Few weeks.
FRANK
Christmas is in a few weeks?
VOICE
Yeah.
FRANK
Okay. Give my love to your
family.
The Irishman D1-5 SZ 9.15.09 135.
VOICE
I will. I’ll see you later.
FRANK
I’m not going anywhere.
From outside the room, the door starts to close, but
stops just short of covering up our view of Frank in the
room.
We can just make him out, in the sliver of light between
the edge of the door and the frame, sitting alone in his
wheelchair.
