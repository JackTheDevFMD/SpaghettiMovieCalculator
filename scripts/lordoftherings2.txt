FADE IN ON:
EXT. THE MISTY MOUNTAINS - DAY
HIGH WIDE AERIAL ON: CAMERA flies over the snow-covered peaks of
the Misty Mountains. As the tranquillity of the scene sinks in,
voices disrupt the peacefulness.
GANDALF (O.S.)
You cannot pass!
FRODO (O.S.)
Gandalf!
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: A faint crash sounds over the landscape.
GANDALF (O.S.)
I am the servant of the Secret Fire,
wielder of the Flame of Anor!
PAN CLOSER TO THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS.
GANDALF (O.S.)(CONT’D)
Go back to the Shadow. The dark fire
will not avail you, flame of Udûn!
TRACK THROUGH THE SIDE OF THE MOUNTAIN TO:
INT. BRIDGE OF KHAZAD-DÛM, MORIA - DAY
WIDE ON: The BALROG slashes at GANDALF with its SWORD OF FLAME
...GANDALF blocks with GLAMDRING ... a ringing clash and the
BALROG’S SWORD SHATTERS into MOLTEN FRAGMENTS!
GANDALF (CONT’D)
(booming)
You shall not pass!!
The BALROG places one foot onto the bridge.
(CONTINUED)

CONTINUED:
GANDALF CRIES ALOUD as he summons his LAST RESERVES OF
STRENGTH!!
He thumps the bridge with his staff...a blinding sheet of white
flame springs up...the staff shatters...the bridge breaks...
right at the BALROG’S feet.
The stone bridge drops away into the GULF...from under the
BALROG. For a moment, the great BEAST remains poised in the air
...then it plunges down:
SLOW MOTION: RELIEF floods FRODO’S face...GANDALF remains
trembling on the lip of the broken bridge.
SLOW MOTION: As the BALROG falls, he lashes out with his whip of
fire...
SLOW MOTION: The thongs of the whip lash and curl around
GANDALF’S knees, dragging him over the brink! GANDALF just
manages to hang on by his fingertips.
FRODO
(screaming)
Gandalf!
GANDALF
(fierce)
Fly, you fools!
FRODO
No!
CLOSE ON: GANDALF lets go his grip and falls away...following
the BALROG into the BOTTOMLESS ABYSS!
FRODO (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Gandalf!
TRACK AT HIGH SPEED WITH GANDALF AS HE PLUMMETS...THE BALROG
SMOKES FROM BELOW...
ANGLE ON: GANDALF snatches GLAMDRING as he plummets head-first
behind the BALROG.
GANDALF alights on the BALROG’S NECK and stabs GLAMDRING deep
into it...the BALROG swipes at GANDALF loosening GANDALF’S grip.
(CONTINUED)
3.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
The BALROG swings at GANDALF several times before snatching
GANDALF in his GRASP...another bounce off the close walls and
GANDALF falls freely again.
GANDALF grabs ahold of the demon’s horn as they continue their
never-ending plunge...The BALROG bounces off the walls as
GANDALF prepares to drive GLAMDRING into its head.
INT. UNDERGROUND CAVERN - DAY
WIDE ON: AT THE UTTERMOST FOUNDATIONS BENEATH THE DEEPEST
DELVINGS OF THE DWARVES, GANDALF and the BALROG emerge like a
small ball of fire high above an enormous body of water in a
cavern without measure.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF’S EYES WIDEN as they crash into the water
below.
CUT TO:
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY
CLOSE ON: FRODO awakens as if from a nightmare.
FRODO
(calling out)
Gandalf!
ANGLE ON: FRODO props himself up, hyperventilating. SAM sits up
behind him.
SAM
What is it, Mr. Frodo?
FRODO
Nothing.
FRODO lies back down.
FRODO (CONT’D)
Just a dream.

EXT. EMYN MUIL - LATER
WIDE ON: FOG lays heavy over the ROCKY LANDSCAPE of EMYN MUIL.
SUPER: THE TWO TOWERS
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM climb down a rock face toward the mistcovered
ground.
SAM
Can you see the bottom?
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks down into the mist.
FRODO
No! Don’t look down, Sam! Just keep
going!
CLOSE ON: SAM clings to the ROPE and nods. He slowly continues.
ANGLE ON: The ROPE is tied securely around a rock at the top of
the face.
ANGLE ON: SAM takes a step and loses his footing...A SMALL BOX
tumbles out of his pocket! He desperately reaches for it.
SAM
Catch it! Grab it, Mr. Frodo!
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks up...THE BOX bounces down the rock...
FRODO deftly catches it.
SUDDENLY, HE LOSES HIS FOOTING AND PLUNGES INTO THE MIST BELOW!
SAM
Mr. Frodo!
After only a few feet, FRODO lands softly on the ground.
Stunned, he looks about for a moment, and then up to SAM.
FRODO
I think I’ve found the bottom.
SAM quickly climbs downward and walks away from the rope.
SAM
Bogs and rope, and goodness knows
what. It ain’t natural, none of it.
(CONTINUED)
5.
 
CONTINUED:
FRODO studies the SMALL BOX.
FRODO
What’s in this?
SAM
Nothing. Just a bit of seasoning.
I thought maybe if we was having a
roast chicken one night or something.
CLOSE ON: SAM looks at FRODO with the greatest of honesty...
FRODO looks at SAM incredulously.
FRODO
Roast chicken?!
SAM shrugs.
SAM
You never know.
FRODO laughs and shakes his head.
FRODO
Sam. My dear Sam.
CLOSE ON: Carefully, FRODO opens the lid to look inside. The
BOX is filled to the brim with SEASONING.
SAM
It’s very special, that. It’s the best
salt in all the Shire.
FRODO
It is special.
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at SAM nostalgically.
FRODO (CONT’D)
It’s a little bit of home.
FRODO hands the box back to SAM and walks over to the rope still
tied at the top of the cliff. He gazes upward.
(CONTINUED)
6.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
FRODO (CONT’D)
We can’t leave this here for someone
to follow us down.
SAM
Who’s gonna to follow us down here,
Mr. Frodo?
FRODO looks at the rope, worried...SAM looks at it longingly.
SAM (CONT’D)
It’s a shame, really. Lady Galadriel
gave me that. Real Elvish rope.
SAM puts the box of seasoning in his pocket and walks over to
the rock face.
SAM (CONT’D)
Well, there’s nothing for it. It’s one
of my knots. Won’t come free in a hurry.
SAM tugs on the rope - hard.
ANGLE ON: The ELVISH ROPE unties itself and plummets.
ANGLE ON: The ROPE lands at SAM’S FEET...SAM stands speechless
for a moment, and then he looks at FRODO who shrugs.
FRODO
Real Elvish rope.
SAM looks briefly at the bit he is still holding, and then at
the summit far above.
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY
WIDE ON: FRODO and SAM climb over the rocky terrain to reach the
summit of another part of EMYN MUIL.
ANGLE ON: They look into the distance at the MORDOR. MOUNT
DOOM belches fire and smoke.
(CONTINUED)
7.
 
CONTINUED:
SAM
Mordor. The one place in Middle-earth
we don’t want to see any closer. And the
one place we’re trying to get to. It’s
just where we can’t get.
CLOSE ON: SAM turns to FRODO, worried.
SAM (CONT’D)
Let’s face it, Mr. Frodo, we’re lost.
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks at SAM, scared.
SAM (CONT’D)
I don’t think Gandalf meant for us to
come this way.
FRODO
He didn’t mean for a lot of things
to happen, Sam ... but they did.
Suddenly, FRODO gasps.
INSERT IMAGE: From deep within Mordor the BLAZING EYE OF
SAURON looks directly upon him from high atop THE TOWER OF
BARAD-DÛR.
ANGLE ON: FRODO shudders and turns away from the sight. He sits,
panting.
ANGLE ON: SAM turns to him.
SAM
Mr. Frodo?
FRODO continues panting, unable to respond.
SAM (CONT’D)
It’s the Ring, isn’t it?
FRODO
It’s getting heavier.
CLOSE ON: FRODO clutches the RING on his chest.
(CONTINUED)
8.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
ANGLE ON: SAM sits behind him and begins to go through his pack.
FRODO fumbles for his water bottle and takes a deep gulp.
FRODO (CONT’D)
What food have we got left?
SAM
Let me see.
CLOSE ON: He takes a LEAF-WRAPPED BIT OF ELVEN BREAD from his
pack.
SAM (CONT’D)
Oh yes, lovely. Lembas bread. And look!
He digs deeper into his pack and pulls out:
SAM (CONT’D)
More Lembas bread.
He breaks off a piece and tosses it to FRODO, and then eats a
piece himself.
SAM (CONT’D)
I don't usually hold with foreign food,
but this Elvish stuff, it’s not bad.
FRODO
(smiling)
Nothing ever dampens your spirits,
does it, Sam?
SAM smiles back, glances at his bread, as if considering another
bite, and then looks ominously off into the distance. His
expression drops.
SAM
Those rain clouds might.
EXT. EMYN MUIL - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM sit huddled together wrapped in their
cloaks...RAIN beats mercilessly down upon them...neither one
sleeps.
(CONTINUED)
9.
 
CONTINUED:
HIGH WIDE ON: The HOBBITS shivering at the base of the rocks...
HARSH BREATHING SOUNDS...A HAND rests on the edge of the cliff.
ANGLE ON: FRODO suddenly looks up.
LOW ANGLE ON: The side of the rock face...nothing is seen on
its peak.
ANGLE ON: FRODO shakes his head and huddles back down into his
cloak.
CUT TO:
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY
ANGLES ON: FRODO and SAM climb over the rocks...walk along a
path...scale the side of a rock face...walk along a summit...
SAM
This looks strangely familiar.
FRODO
(exasperated)
It’s because we’ve been here before.
We’re going in circles.
SAM walks to an overlook.
SAM
What's that horrid stink? I warrant
there's a nasty bog nearby. Can you
smell it?
FRODO
Yes. I can smell it.
FRODO walks over to join SAM at the overlook.
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks to SAM ominously.
FRODO (CONT’D)
(whispers)
We’re not alone.
CUT TO:
10.
 
EXT. EMYN MUIL - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM sleep.
HIGH WIDE: A dark, spidery shape appears on top of the cliff
and makes its way down to the slumbering HOBBITS.
ANGLE ON: The emaciated creature is dressed only in a tattered
loincloth, and appears mostly human in appearance. Its frame is
quite thin, but its hands, feet, and eyes are oversized. What
hair remains is thin and falls where it may about its shoulders.
It descends the rock face upside down like an insect. This is
GOLLUM. He speaks in an ancient, gravely voice.
GOLLUM
The thieves. The thieves. The filthy
little thieves. Where is it?
CRANE BEHIND GOLLUM as he climbs down.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Where is it? They stole it from us.
My precious. Curse them, we hates them!
It’s ours, it is, and we wants it!
GOLLUM reaches his hand out to snatch his prize.
SUDDENLY, the HOBBITS spring and snatch GOLLUM off the side of
the rock. Amidst the struggle, GOLLUM wriggles loose and throws
them both away from him.
As FRODO falls back, the RING comes out of his shirt.
GOLLUM recovers and sees the RING. He leaps straight for it.
GOLLUM desperately tries to get his hands on his
precious while FRODO struggles to prevent this.
SAM recovers and grabs GOLLUM by the ankle, dragging him
away from FRODO...GOLLUM reels back and hits SAM in the face,
knocking him away.
He pounces back on FRODO and reaches for the RING...FRODO
grabs Gollum’s hand, and struggles against his considerable
strength.
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM’S cheeks puff with exertion as he struggles
with FRODO, his enormous eyes fixed on the RING.
(CONTINUED)
11.
 
CONTINUED:
ANGLE ON: SAM comes up from behind GOLLUM again, and lifts
him off of FRODO...GOLLUM grasps FRODO, throwing him off to
one side as SAM swings GOLLUM around.
GOLLUM leaps from Sam’s grasp onto the rock wall beside them,
and then back on top of FRODO.
SAM pulls GOLLUM off again, and GOLLUM turns on him...he
fiercely bits SAM on the neck. SAM struggles against him,
but GOLLUM reels around, wraps his legs around SAM and tries to
choke him!
SAM falls to the ground atop GOLLUM, but GOLLUM continues to
have the upper hand.
SUDDENLY, FRODO grabs GOLLUM by the hair, and holds STING to
his neck.
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM’S eyes go wide, and he freezes. He maintains a
hold on SAM.
FRODO
(menacingly)
This is Sting. You’ve seen it before,
haven’t you ... Gollum?
ANGLE ON: SAM tries to break GOLLUM’S grip, unsuccessfully.
FRODO (CONT’D)
Release him or I’ll cut your throat!
ANGLE ON: Slowly, GOLLUM loosens his grip on SAM...and then
WAILS.
CUT TO:
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY
WIDE ON: Gollum’s wail ECHOES across the vast, rocky landscape
of EMYN MUIL.
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM walks through EMYN MUIL...SAM tugs on
the rope and GOLLUM stumbles behind them. GOLLUM continues to
SCREAM and WAIL.
(CONTINUED)
12.
 
CONTINUED:
GOLLUM
It burns! It burns us! It freezes!
Nasty Elves twisted it. Take it off
us!
SAM continues dragging GOLLUM, willing or not, across the rocks.
SAM
Quiet, you!
GOLLUM stops again.
SAM tugs fiercely at the rope to try and get him to come along,
but GOLLUM wails again, unmoving. SAM turns to FRODO in dismay.
SAM (CONT’D)
It’s hopeless. Every Orc in Mordor’s
going to hear this racket. Let’s just
tie him up and leave him.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM stops crying at once and turns to the HOBBITS
wide-eyed and pleading.
GOLLUM
No! That would kill us! Kill us!
SAM
It’s no more than you deserve!
GOLLUM wails again and COLLAPSES onto the ground, writhing.
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks down to GOLLUM.
FRODO
Maybe he does deserve to die. But now
that I see him, I do pity him.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM suddenly stops and turns to FRODO, smiling.
GOLLUM
(begging)
We be nice to them if they be nice
to us. Take it off us.
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM look at GOLLUM warily.
(CONTINUED)
13.
 
CONTINUED:
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
We swears to do what you wants. We
swears.
FRODO
There’s no promise you can make that I
can trust.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM scrambles up and bows to FRODO desperately.
GOLLUM
(smiling)
We swears to serve the master of the
precious. We will swear on the...on
the precious.
(coughing)
Gollum. Gollum.
FRODO
The Ring is treacherous. It will hold
you to your word.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM crawls over to FRODO.
GOLLUM
Yes...on the precious. On the precious.
SAM
I don’t believe you!
ANGLE ON: SAM lunges at GOLLUM...GOLLUM jumps away, frightened,
and climbs onto a boulder.
SAM (CONT’D)
Get down! I said, down!
SAM jerks strongly at the rope. GOLLUM crashes to the ground,
choking.
FRODO
Sam!
SAM
He’s trying to trick us! If we let
him go he’ll throttle us in our
sleep.
(CONTINUED)
14.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM lies panting and holding his throat. He backs
away, frightened, as FRODO approaches him.
FRODO
You know the way to Mordor?
GOLLUM
(warily)
Yes.
FRODO
You’ve been there before?
GOLLUM
Yes.
ANGLE ON: FRODO reaches out and removes the rope from GOLLUM’S
neck. GOLLUM is surprised and relieved.
CLOSE ON: SAM is displeased.
FRODO
You will lead us to the Black Gate.
CUT TO:
EXT. EMYN MUIL - DAY
TRACK WITH: GOLLUM scrambles quickly through the rocky crags,
looking back to make sure the HOBBITS are behind him.
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM struggle to keep his pace.
SMÉAGOL
To the Gate, to the Gate! To the Gate,
the master says. Yes!
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM sports an EVIL FACE.
GOLLUM
No! We won’t go back. Not there.
Not to him. They can’t make us.
(coughing)
Gollum! Gollum!
(CONTINUED)
15.
 
CONTINUED:
He scrambles on further and stops atop a rock. His FACE turns
suddenly SOFT.
SMÉAGOL
(pleading)
But we swore to serve the master of
the precious.
GOLLUM
No. Ashes and dust and thirst there
is, and pits, pits, pits.
ANGLE ON: SAM and FRODO run up behind him, listening.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
And Orcses, thousands of Orcses.
And always the Great Eye watching,
watching.
He hides in face in his hands at the horror of the thought.
Suddenly, he looks back to see SAM and FRODO. He lets out a
frightening growl and runs off down the path.
SAM starts forward.
GOLLUM leaps down a rock wall and scurries away from the
HOBBITS.
SAM
Hey! Come back now! Come back!
SAM and FRODO try to follow, but he has escaped them.
SAM (CONT’D)
There! What did I tell you? He’s run
off, the old villain. So much for his
promises.
GOLLUM pops up behind a nearby rock.
GOLLUM
This way, Hobbits. Follow me!
FRODO quickly runs after him. SAM, with a scowl, concedes to
follow as well.
CUT TO:
16.
 
EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY
CRANE DOWN TO: A BAND OF URUK-HAI runs across ROHAN. MERRY and
PIPPIN, ride on the backs of two URUK-HAI, their hands bound
around the URUK-HAIS’ necks.
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN tries to call to MERRY, who is unconscious
with a gash on his brow.
PIPPIN
Merry! Merry!
MERRY does not respond.
ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY, the leading URUK-HAI, MAÚHUR, signals a
stop. He sniffs the air.
ANGLE ON: Several Orcs from the North emerge from behind some
rocks. They are led by a short, crook-legged Orc, very broad
with long arms that hang almost to the ground called GRISHNÁKH.
GRISHNÁKH
You’re late. Our master grows impatient.
He wants the Shire-rats now.
ANGLE ON: UGLÚK looks at MAÚHUR amused.
UGLÚK
I don’t take orders from Orc-maggots.
ANGLE ON: GRISHNÁKH’S face falls.
UGLÚK (CONT’D)
Saruman will have his prize. We will
deliver them.
UGLÚK turns away from the Northern Orcs.
ANGLE ON: GRISHNÁKH mocks him as he walks away, but they make
no move on the URUK-HAI.
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN tries again to rouse MERRY.
PIPPIN
Merry! Merry? Wake up.
ANGLE ON: MERRY’S head lolls around, unresponsive. PIPPIN looks
over to an Orc drinking his draught.
(CONTINUED)
17.
 
CONTINUED:
PIPPIN (CONT’D)
My friend is sick.
ANGLE ON: An URUK-HAI turns to PIPPIN and growls.
PIPPIN (CONT’D)
He needs water. Please!
ANGLE ON: UGLÚK makes his way through the ranks to the
prisoners.
UGLÚK
Sick, is he? Give him some medicine,
boys!
The ORCS laugh and dump their ORC-DRAUGHT down MERRY’S throat.
MERRY chokes on the foul stuff.
PIPPIN
Stop it!
UGLÚK
Can’t take his draught!
The Orcs laugh again as MERRY chokes on the draught.
PIPPIN
Leave him alone!
UGLÚK
Why?
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN looks at UGLÚK, afraid to respond.
UGLÚK (CONT’D)
You want some?
PIPPIN doesn’t respond.
UGLÚK (CONT’D)
Then keep your mouth shut.
UGLÚK turns and walks away.
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN turns to MERRY.
(CONTINUED)
18.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
PIPPIN
Merry.
ANGLE ON: MERRY groggily lifts his head.
MERRY
Hello, Pip.
PIPPIN
You’re hurt.
MERRY
(smiling uneasily)
I’m fine. It was just an act.
PIPPIN
(disbelieving)
An act?
MERRY
See? I fooled you too.
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN smiles uneasily.
MERRY (CONT’D)
Don’t worry about me, Pippin.
ANGLE ON: MAÚHUR sniffs the air again. UGLÚK appears behind
him.
UGLÚK
What is it? What do you smell?
MAÚHUR
Man-flesh.
UGLÚK
They've picked up our trail.
PIPPIN
(quietly to himself)
Aragorn!
UGLÚK
(loudly, to the company)
Let's move!
(CONTINUED)
19.
 
CONTINUED: (3)
The URUK-HAI break into a run. The NORTHERN ORCS follow.
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN struggles to remove his ELVEN BROOCH from his
LÓRIEN cloak with his teeth. Once he has it, he spits it onto
the ground.
CLOSE ON: The brooch lands in the grass. The URUK-HAI trample
it, but it remains unbroken and visible.
CUT TO:
EXT. WESTERN EMYN MUIL - DAY
ARAGORN lies on the ground with his eyes closed and ear pressed
to the ground, listening. Suddenly, he opens his eyes.
ARAGORN
(softly)
Their pace has quickened.
He climbs to his feet.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)
They must have caught our scent.
(desperately)
Hurry!
He takes off Northward.
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS is running up the hill behind him. He stops
and turns behind him.
LEGOLAS
Come on, Gimli!
He runs onward. GIMLI struggles up the hill.
ANGLE ON: GIMLI pauses in his steps and huffs.
GIMLI
Three days and nights pursuit. No food.
No rest. And no sign of our quarry but
what bare rock can tell.
He runs after his companions beyond the boundaries of EMYN MUIL.

over a trickling stream at least twenty leagues below.
EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY

grass in the open plains. A HAND suddenly reaches down to pick
it up. ARAGORN draws it to his face, and then looks ahead.
ARAGORN
Not idly do the leaves of Lórien fall.
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS stops and turns to ARAGORN.
LEGOLAS
They may yet be alive.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN briefly studies the ground, and starts to run
again.
ARAGORN
Less than a day ahead of us. Come.
ARAGORN takes off.
ANGLE ON: GIMLI stumbles from behind some rocks and rolls to the
ground. LEGOLAS stops and turns to him.
LEGOLAS
Come, Gimli! We are gaining on them!
GIMLI
(panting)
I am wasted on cross-country. We
dwarves are natural sprinters. Very
dangerous over short distances.
ANGLE ON: The HUNTERS come over a hill and pause as they gaze
across the open fields of ROHAN.
ARAGORN
Rohan. Home of the Horse-lords. There’s
something strange at work here. Some
evil gives speed to these creatures.
Sets its will against us.
(CONTINUED)
21.
 
CONTINUED:
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS runs ahead and looks out to the horizon.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)
Legolas! What do your Elf eyes see?

Mordor?

To stand against the might of

finished swords are cooled...helmets are created...swords are
pounded into shape...ORCS add the completed swords to a large
pile...URUK-HAI are birthed into creation...an ORC inspects the

spear and the iron fists of the Orc.
EXT. ISENGARD - DAY
WIDE ON: SARUMAN stands on a scaffold high above the CAVERNS.
Far below, hundreds of ORCS go about their duties. SARUMAN turns

within two weeks!

23.
 
CONTINUED:
ORC OVERSEER
But, my lord, there are too many! They
cannot all be armed in time, we don’t
have the means.
SARUMAN
Build a dam, block the stream, work
the furnaces night and day.

We don’t have enough fuel to feed the

The Horse-men took your land.

They drove your people into the hills to
scratch a living off rocks.
WILD MAN
Murderers!
The crowd descends quickly into a mob rule, quickly agreeing
with the MAN.

FREDA
Papa says Éothain must not ride Garulf.
He is too big for him!
MORWEN lifts FREDA onto the horse in front of her brother.
MORWEN
Listen to me. You must ride to Edoras
and raise the alarm. Do you understand
me?
ÉOTHAIN
Yes, Mama!
FREDA starts to cry, and reaches for her mother.
FREDA
I don’t want to leave. I don't want to

ÉOWYN
Théodred!
ANGLE ON: THÉODRED head lolls, unresponsive.

sees THÉODRED’S fatal wound. She gasps, knowing the meaning. She
looks to ÉOMER, who nods.
INT. MAIN HALL, MEDUSELD - DAY
WIDE ON: ÉOMER and ÉOWYN stand before the king, THÉODEN, who
sits motionless on his throne, wizened, and aged beyond his
years. ÉOWYN kisses his cheeks and kneels before him.
ÉOWYN (CONT’D)
Your son is badly wounded, my lord.
ÉOMER
He was ambushed by Orcs.
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN makes no response. He stares off into the
distance.
ÉOMER (CONT’D)
If we don’t defend our country,
Saruman will take it by force.
WORMTONGUE (O.S.)
That is a lie.
ANGLE ON: GRÍMA WORMTONGUE appears from the shadows. He walks
over to stand beside the king.
WORMTONGUE (CONT’D)
Saruman the White has ever been our
friend and ally.

THÉODEN

Gríma... Gríma...

ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE leans down close to the King.
THÉODEN (CONT’D)
My son... Gríma...
ÉOMER
Orcs are running freely across our
lands. Unchecked. Unchallenged.
Killing at will. Orcs bearing the White
Hand of Saruman.
ANGLE ON: ÉOMER drops one of the ORC HELMETS onto the ground,
which topples over to reveal the WHITE HAND OF SARUMAN.
ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE looks at it, as if considering his words.
Finally, he speaks, but kneels down to THÉODRED, as if speaking
to the king.
WORMTONGUE
Why do you lay these troubles on an
already troubled mind? Can you not
see? Your uncle is wearied by your
malcontent, your warmongering.
ANGLE ON: ÉOMER looks over to WORMTONGUE, surprised.
ÉOMER
Warmongering?
ÉOMER grabs WORMTONGUE and pins him against a pillar.
ÉOMER (CONT’D)
How long is it since Saruman bought
you? What was the promised price,
Gríma? When all the Men are dead, you
will take your share of the treasure?
CLOSE ON: WORMTONGUE’S eyes flicks to right. ÉOMER follows his
glance.
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN pauses to stare back for a moment before
departing from the hall.

Too long have you watched my sister.
Too long have you haunted her steps.

smiles as ÉOMER is suddenly pulled off WORMTONGUE by his thugs.
WORMTONGUE
You see much, Éomer, Son of Éomund.
Too much.
The thugs punch ÉOMER in the stomach.
WORMTONGUE (CONT’D)
You are banished forthwith from the
kingdom of Rohan and all its domains
under pain of death.
ANGLE ON: ÉOMER struggles against the MEN.
ÉOMER
You have no authority here. Your
orders mean nothing.
One of the MEN punches ÉOMER in the stomach again.
WORMTONGUE
(shaking his head and smiling)
This order does not come from me.
It comes from the king.
ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE holds up a document with a sloppy scrawl of
a signature at the bottom.
WORMTONGUE (CONT’D)
He signed it this morning.

What’s making that noise?
MERRY looks toward the forest. He smiles.
MERRY
It’s the trees.
PIPPIN
What?
MERRY
Do you remember the Old Forest, on the
borders of Buckland? Folk used to say
there was something in the water that
made the trees grow tall...and come
alive.
PIPPIN
Alive?
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: Another groan issues from the Forest.
MERRY
Trees that could whisper, talk to each
other, even move.
ANGLE ON: An URUK-HAI stares at a piece of bread, and then
throws it to the ground.
URUK-HAI
I'm starving. We ain't had nothing

to the side.
ANGLE ON: GRISHNÁKH watches their movements hungrily.
GRISHNÁKH
What about their legs? They don't need
those. They look tasty.
GRISHNÁKH makes a move towards the HOBBITS. UGLÚK shoves him
back into the ORCS.
UGLÚK
Get back, scum!
The ORCS spring forward and scowl at UGLÚK.
UGLÚK (CONT’D)
The prisoners go to Saruman. Alive
and unspoiled.
GRISHNÁKH
Alive?
ANGLE ON: GRISHNÁKH feints to one side of UGLÚK to have
another good look at the HOBBITS.

we’re dead.
ANGLE ON: SNAGA rises up from behind the HOBBITS and raises
his blade.
SNAGA
Just a mouthful. A bit of the flank.
MERRY and PIPPIN gasp.
SUDDENLY, UGLÚK swings his weapon...MERRY and PIPPIN shudder

turn around to see his body stand for a moment, and then topple
over.
UGLÚK
Looks like meat’s back on the menu,

GRISHNÁKH grabs PIPPIN by the face and pulls him closer.
GRISHNÁKH (CONT’D)
Squeal. No one’s gonna save you now.
ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY, a SPEAR pierces GRISHNÁKH’S back.
He screams and rolls off of PIPPIN...PIPPIN and MERRY look up
to see who threw the spear.
ANGLES ON: The ORCS halt their feast and look into the darkness

numbers.

GIMLI to hasten behind a nearby rock formation to hide.
WIDE ON: The ÉOMER AND HIS RIDERS OF ROHAN ride over the hill.

ANGLE ON: ÉOMER hands his staff to another RIDER, and gets off
his horse.
ANGLE ON: GIMLI gives an arrogant nod at ÉOMER’S approach.
ARAGORN puts a hand on GIMLI’S shoulder to stay him.
ÉOMER
I would cut off your head, beard
and all, Master Dwarf, if it stood
but a little higher from the
ground.
ANGLE ON: In a lightning fast move, LEGOLAS nocks an arrow,
and points it at ÉOMER.
LEGOLAS
You would die before your stroke fell.
IN A TENSE MOMENT, ALL SPEARS ARE TRAINED ON LEGOLAS.
ARAGORN lowers LEGOLAS’ bow.
ARAGORN
I am Aragorn, son of Arathorn. This
is Gimli, son of Glóin and Legolas
of the Woodland Realm. We are friends
of Rohan and of Théoden, your king.
ÉOMER
Théoden no longer recognizes friend

ÉOMER (CONT’D)
Saruman has poisoned the mind of the
king and claimed lordship over these
lands. My company are those loyal to
Rohan. And for that, we are banished.
(quietly to the THREE; accusing)
The White Wizard is cunning. He walks
here and there, they say, as an old man
hooded and cloaked. And everywhere, his
spies slip past our nets.
ARAGORN
We are no spies. We track a party of
Uruk-Hai westward across the plain. They
have taken two of our friends captive.
ÉOMER
The Uruks are destroyed. We slaughtered
them during the night.
ANGLE ON: GIMLI springs forward.
GIMLI
(desperately)
But there were two Hobbits. Did you
see two Hobbits with them?
ARAGORN
They would be small. Only children to
your eyes.
ÉOMER
(shaking his head)
We left none alive. We piled the
carcasses and burned them.

hand on them.
ÉOMER
May these horses bear you to better
fortune than their former masters.
Farewell.
ÉOMER puts on his helmet and returns to his horse.
ÉOMER
Look for your friends. But do not trust
to hope. It has forsaken these lands.

defeat and falls to his knees, hanging his head low. He sits in
despair.
GIMLI
We failed them.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns his head. Something on the ground
suddenly catches his attention. A glimmer of hope flickers
across his visage as he notes some marks on the ground. He moves
towards them, and touches the spots with his hands.
ARAGORN
A Hobbit lay here. And the other.
He sits back to ponder the meaning of these marks.
INTERCUT WITH: PIPPIN screams as the HORSE rears over him. He
rolls out of the way as it CRASHES DOWN.

one side.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)

furiously against its sharp edge.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN comes upon a short length of rope buried in
the trampled grass.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)
Their bonds were cut.
He continues tracking across the grass.

ARAGORN
The tracks lead away from the battle...

short of entering FANGORN.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)

the forest.
POV: GRISHNÁKH is nowhere in sight. MERRY sighs with relief.
MERRY (CONT’D)
He's gone.
SUDDENLY, MERRY is jerked out of the tree.
ANGLE ON: He falls to the ground in a heap, and GRISHNÁKH looms
over him, hungrily. MERRY kicks him in the face, but he is
undeterred. MERRY attempts to back away from his attacker, but
GRISHNÁKH maintains his superior position.
PIPPIN

to Pippin’s yell, TWO YELLOW EYES flicker open on the tree.
PIPPIN glances over to them, and then back to MERRY.
Realization dawns on him, and he slowly looks back at the EYES.
The TREE grimaces and then turns its head to looks directly at
PIPPIN.
Speechless, PIPPIN loses his grip and begins to fall.
The TREE lifts one of its limbs and catches PIPPIN in its hand
before he can get very far.

PIPPIN
Don’t talk to it, Merry. Don’t
encourage it!
TREEBEARD
TREEBEARD, some call me.
PIPPIN
And whose side are you on?
TREEBEARD
Side? I am on nobody’s side because
nobody’s on my side, little Orc.
Nobody cares for the woods anymore.
MERRY
We’re not Orcs! We’re Hobbits!
TREEBEARD
Hobbits? Never heard of a Hobbit
before. Sounds like Orc mischief to me!
He squeezes the HOBBITS in rage...MERRY and PIPPIN squirm in
pain.
TREEBEARD (CONT’D)
(angrily)
They come with fire. They come with
axes. Gnawing, biting, breaking,
hacking, burning! Destroyers and
usurpers! Curse them!
MERRY
No! You don’t understand. We’re
Hobbits! Halflings! Shire-folk!

I hate this place. It’s too quiet.
There’s been no sight or sound of
a bird for two days.
GOLLUM
No, no birdses to eat. No crunchable
birdses.
(CONTINUED)
48.
 
CONTINUED:
SAM locates some LEMBAS BREAD in his pack and hands some to
FRODO, before getting some for himself. GOLLUM pounds the ground
in frustration.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
We are famished! Yes! Famished we are,
precious!
Suddenly, GOLLUM sees something on the ground. His eyes dart
around following it, before his hands move like lightning to
snatch up-
-a worm. He looks at it suspiciously, shakes it a little, and
then slurps it down with a grimace.
CLOSE ON: SAM grimaces as well and opts out of finishing his
bit of LAMBAS BREAD.
ANGLE ON: FRODO breaks a piece off of his bread and tosses it to
GOLLUM.
FRODO
Here.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM snaps around to look at it.
GOLLUM
What does it eats?
He runs over to the piece on the ground and circles it like a
hungry animal.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Is it tasty?
He picks it up and tosses it into his mouth. Almost immediately,
he dramatically chokes on it and spits it out.
CLOSE ON: SAM rolls his eyes and sighs.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM hacks and coughs.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
It tries to chokes us! We can’t eats
Hobbit food! We must starve!
(CONTINUED)
49.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
GOLLUM bawls and falls onto his back, whining.
SAM
Well, starve, then. And good riddance!
GOLLUM crawls toward SAM.
GOLLUM
Oh, cruel Hobbit. It does not care if
we be hungry. Does not care if we
should die.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM turns to FRODO, his eyes growing wide and
innocent.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Not like master.
ANGLE ON: FRODO ignores GOLLUM’S words.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Master cares. Master knows.
FRODO looks to GOLLUM, beginning to understand.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Yes. Precious.
CLOSE ON: FRODO raises his hand to cover the RING hidden under
his tunic.
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM mimics his action, watching where FRODO holds.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Once it takes hold of us, it never
lets go.
ANGLE ON: FRODO is tranced by the truth of Gollum’s words.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM reaches out to touch the RING...FRODO comes
to, and slaps Gollum’s hand away.
FRODO
Don’t touch me!
GOLLUM shrinks away from FRODO. There is a tense moment before
GOLLUM backs away from FRODO and lies down on the ground.
50.
 
EXT. THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY
GOLLUM leads SAM and FRODO into an area of the marshes where
small flames burn on the surface of the mist-covered waters.
ANGLE ON: SAM suddenly stops and glimpses beneath the water’s
surface.
ANGLE ON: PALLID FACES of dead MEN and ELVES float in the water.
SAM
There are dead things! Dead faces in
the water.
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks to the disturbing sight.
GOLLUM
All dead. All rotten. Elves and Men
and Orcses. A great battle long ago.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM stops and turns to the HOBBITS.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Dead Marshes. Yes. Yes, that is their
name.
(gesturing and moving on)
This way. Don’t follow the lights.
ANGLE ON: SAM slips into the water again...GOLLUM turns to
them quickly.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Careful now!
CLOSE ON: The DEAD FACES IN THE WATER.
GOLLUM (O.S.) (CONT’D)
Or Hobbits go down to join the dead ones
and light little candles of their own.
ANGLE ON: SAM warily follows GOLLUM, but FRODO is drawn toward
the water.
ANGLE ON: One of the DEAD dressed in ELVEN ARMOUR. It floats
just beneath the surface with a disturbing peacefulness.
ANGLE ON: FRODO draws himself closer and closer to the water.
(CONTINUED)
51.
 
CONTINUED:
ANGLE ON: SAM looks around. His face drops when he sees where
FRODO is.
SAM
Frodo!
ANGLE ON: FRODO pays SAM no mind, but continues to stare at the
DEAD ELF in the water.
CLOSE ON: SUDDENLY, the Dead Elf’s eyes snap open. Its blank,
pallid stare looks straight at FRODO.
ANGLE ON: FRODO registers surprise only for a moment before
falling face-first into the marsh...SAM bolts toward him.
INT. THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY
ANGLE ON: FRODO floats beneath the surface. He looks about in
fear...a decayed face silently screams and moves toward him,
reaching out its rotten hand...
Panicked, FRODO tries to escape. Two more DEAD grasp him from
behind. The DEAD quickly surrounded him, grasping with decayed
limbs.
Another hand reaches around FRODO, and he collapses into the
dead behind him.
EXT. THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY
GOLLUM pulls FRODO out of the BOG...FRODO gasps and sputters
for air...GOLLUM drags the struggling FRODO completely out of
the water, and lays him on the ground.
ANGLE ON: FRODO finally comes to and looks over to his savior,
in perplexed gratitude and disbelief.
FRODO
Gollum?
GOLLUM
(emphatically)
Don’t follow the lights.
He crawls away. SAM runs to Frodo’s side.
(CONTINUED)
52.
 
CONTINUED:
FRODO
Gollum!
SAM
Mr. Frodo! Are you all right?
SAM drags FRODO away from the swamp. FRODO stares after GOLLUM.
CUT TO:
EXT. THE DEAD MARSHES - NIGHT
WIDE ON: MOUNT DOOM chokes ash and fire, giving light to the
night.
PAN OVER THE CAMP: The HOBBITS sleep...or so it appears.
ANGLE ON: FRODO holds the RING in the palm of his hand,
caressing it...gazing upon it.
SUDDENLY, he hears GOLLUM. He grasps the RING, as if to hide
it.
GOLLUM (O.S.)
So bright. So beautiful.
FRODO quickly stuffs the RING inside his shirt.
ANGLE ON: FRODO rolls over. GOLLUM crouches away from him,
stroking the centre of his palm, just as FRODO was doing only
a moment before.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Our precious.
FRODO
What did you say?
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM calmly turns to FRODO, still lost in his own
reverie.
GOLLUM
Master should be resting. Master needs
to keep up his strength.
FRODO gets up and stands behind GOLLUM.
(CONTINUED)
53.
 
CONTINUED:
FRODO
Who are you?
GOLLUM
(quickly)
Mustn’t ask us. Not its business.
(coughing)
Gollum. Gollum.
FRODO crouches behind him.
FRODO
Gandalf told me you were one of the
river-folk.
GOLLUM
(absently; ignoring Frodo)
Cold be heart and hand and bone
Cold be travelers far from home
FRODO
He said your life was a sad story.
GOLLUM
They do not see what lies ahead,
when sun has failed and moon is dead.
FRODO
You were not so very different from
a Hobbit once. Were you?
He looks closely at GOLLUM, who tries to ignore him.
FRODO (CONT’D)
Sméagol.
CLOSE ON: GOLLUM reacts. He looks up slowly. His face changes to
that of surprise and wonder.
GOLLUM
What did you call me?
FRODO
That was your name once, wasn’t it?
A long time ago.
(CONTINUED)
54.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
GOLLUM
(with difficulty)
My name...my name...
(smiling)
Sméagol.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: A piercing cry breaks the silence of the
night.
ANGLES ON: SAM snaps around, waking up instantly...FRODO looks
around quickly...GOLLUM gasps and lays close to the ground,
trying to hide.
SAM
Black Riders!
GOLLUM
Hide! Hide!
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM runs off. FRODO grasps the RING and groans in
agony.
FLASH INSERT: The faces of the RINGWRAITHS bear down on FRODO.
The WITCH KING reaches for the RING.
ANGLE ON: FRODO collapses onto the ground, wincing.
FLASH INSERT: Surrounded by the RINGWRAITHS, the WITCH KING
reels back and stabs FRODO with his blade.
ANGLE ON: FRODO lurches reliving the act, clutching his
shoulder...SAM runs over to him...he passes GOLLUM, hiding under
a small tree.
SAM
Come on, Frodo! Come on!
SAM drags FRODO across the ground toward GOLLUM.
GOLLUM
Quick! They will see us! They will
see us!
SAM finally gets FRODO over with GOLLUM under the tree.
(CONTINUED)
55.
 
CONTINUED: (3)
SAM
I thought they were dead!
GOLLUM
(shaking his head)
Dead? No, you cannot kill them. No.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM and SAM look out to see if they can spot the
RINGWRAITH.
EXT. SKIES ABOVE THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY
CLOSE ON: ARMOURED HANDS grip the reins of a flying FELLBEAST.
ANGLE ON: The RINGWRAITH looks out from behind the darkness of
his hood.
AERIAL ON: SCREAMS of the DARK RIDER fill the air as the winged
beast flies over the Marshes.
EXT. THE DEAD MARSHES - DAY
GOLLUM whelps and cowers as the RINGWRAITH swoops over their
hiding place.
ANGLE ON: SAM ducks, covering FRODO.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Wraiths! Wraiths on wings!
CLOSE ON: FRODO’S eyes roll back into his head as the shrieks
of the NAZGÛL penetrate him. He clutches the RING at his chest.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM looks over to him, concerned.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
They are calling for it. They are
calling for the precious.
CLOSE ON: FRODO hyperventilates and continues clutching the
RING as it tries to take him and respond to the calls of the
WRAITHS. SAM grabs Frodo’s hand and shakes him.
SAM
Mr. Frodo! It’s alright. I’m here.
(CONTINUED)
56.
 
CONTINUED:
AERIAL ON: The RINGWRAITH passes over them once more before
turning towards MORDOR.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM watches it go, and then turns to the HOBBITS,
as they sit up.
GOLLUM
Hurry, Hobbits. The Black Gate is very
close.
CUT TO:
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - DAY
CLOSE ON: A DARK STAIN dominates a leaf of one of the many
plants on the floor of FANGORN FOREST...Someone approaches...A
HAND touches the stain and brings it up to his mouth...It is
GIMLI...He spits out the offending substance.
GIMLI
Orc blood.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN scours the forest floor, following the tracks
of the HOBBITS. LEGOLAS follows closely, and GIMLI joins them.
ARAGORN suddenly halts, regarding his latest findings.
ARAGORN
These are strange tracks.
GIMLI
(fearful)
The air is so close in here.
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS looks about the forest, as if feeling it.
LEGOLAS
This forest is old. Very old. Full of
memory...and anger.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: Low groans reverberate throughout the
forest.
ANGLE ON: GIMLI gasps and raises his axe.
LEGOLAS (CONT’D)
The trees are speaking to each other.
(CONTINUED)
57.
 
CONTINUED:
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN turns to GIMLI, who is fearfully waving his
axe about, looking for foes.
ARAGORN
(whispering)
Gimli!
ANGLE ON: GIMLI starts at the sound of his name.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)
(gesturing)
Lower your axe.
GIMLI recollects himself and lowers his axe, as if
surrendering.
LEGOLAS
(reverently)
They have feelings, my friend. The
Elves began it. Waking up the
trees, teaching them to speak.
GIMLI
(in disbelief)
Talking trees. What do trees have
to talk about? Except the consistency
of squirrel droppings.
They continue walking through the forest.
ANGLE ON: SUDDENLY, LEGOLAS senses something and runs off for a
better look.
LEGOLAS
(in ELVISH; subtitled)
Aragorn, nad nâ ennas!
Something is out there.
CLOSE ON: LEGOLAS intently searches the FOREST. ARAGORN comes
up behind him.
(CONTINUED)
58.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
ARAGORN
(in ELVISH; subtitled)
Man cenich?
What do you see?
LEGOLAS
(whispered)
The White Wizard approaches.
CLOSE ON: The THREE HUNTERS weigh the gravity of this
pronouncement.
ARAGORN
(whispered)
Do not let him speak. He will put a
spell on us.
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN readies his sword...GIMLI grips his axes...
LEGOLAS nocks an arrow.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)
(whispered)
We must be quick.
QUICK SERIES OF CUTS: WITH A YELL, the three swing round to
attack...a bright light envelops them from the WIZARD...GIMLI
throws his axe...it is shattered...LEGOLAS launches an arrow...
it is deflected...ARAGORN’S sword becomes red hot in his grasp
...it clatters to the forest floor.
ANGLE ON: The THREE HUNTERS shield their eyes from the blinding
light emanating from the WHITE WIZARD.
WHITE WIZARD
You are tracking the footsteps of
two young Hobbits.
ARAGORN
Where are they?
WHITE WIZARD
They passed this way the day before
yesterday. They met someone they
did not expect. Does that comfort you?
(CONTINUED)
59.
 
CONTINUED: (3)
ARAGORN
Who are you? Show yourself!
ANGLE ON: The WHITE WIZARD recalls his light...slowly, his face
is revealed...standing before them, DRESSED ALL IN WHITE, is
GANDALF!
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks upon him, astounded.
ARAGORN
It cannot be.
LEGOLAS
(kneeling)
Forgive me. I mistook you for Saruman.
GIMLI joins LEGOLAS in bowing before the light of GANDALF.
GANDALF
I am Saruman. Or rather, Saruman as he
should have been.
ARAGORN
You fell.
GANDALF
Through fire and water.
EXT. DURIN’S TOWER, SILVERTINE - FLASHBACK
WIDE ON: In a raging snowstorm, high atop SILVERTINE in the
living rock of ZIRAKZIGIL, GANDALF faces off with the BALROG in
DURIN’S TOWER.
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
From the lowest dungeon to the highest
peak, I fought with the Balrog of
Morgoth.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF holds up GLAMDRING...lightning energizes it.
THE BALROG charges GANDALF again...GANDALF plunges GLAMDRING
into the BALROG.
WIDE ON: With a final cry, the BALROG falls, smoking, from the
peak and lands on the icy mountainside.
(CONTINUED)
60.
 
CONTINUED:
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Until at last, I threw down my enemy and
smote his ruin upon the mountainside.
ANGLE ON: High above the BALROG, GANDALF lies upon the snowy
peak, dying.
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Darkness took me, and I strayed out
of thought and time.
TRACK IN TO GANDALF’S EYE...A BRIGHT LIGHT erupts...
INSERT IMAGE: DEATH...BIRTH...COSMIC WEIRDNESS...
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Stars wheeled overhead and every day was
as long as a life age of the Earth.
WHITE LIGHT ENVELOPES THE IMAGE...
TRACK OUT FROM GANDALF’S EYE...
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
But it was not the end. I felt life
in me again.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF lies upon the ground - naked, calm, and still.
His hair has turned white, and his wounds are healed. He
suddenly utters with a deep gasp and pants as life returns to
him.
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
I've been sent back...
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - DAY
GANDALF (CONT’D)
...until my task is done.
ARAGORN
Gandalf.
(CONTINUED)
61.
 
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
(momentarily confused)
Gandalf? Yes.
(smiling)
That's what they used to call me.
ARAGORN nods...GANDALF looks at ARAGORN, smiling.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Gandalf the Grey. That was my name.
GIMLI
Gandalf.
GANDALF
(with a smile)
I am Gandalf the White.
LEGOLAS grins.
GANDALF
And I come back to you now at the
turn of the tide.
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - DAY
WIDE ON: GANDALF leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI through the
forest. He wears his ELVEN CLOAK over his white robes.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
One stage of the journey is over,
another begins. We must travel to
Edoras with all speed.
GIMLI
Edoras? That is no short distance!
ARAGORN
We hear of trouble in Rohan. It goes ill
with the king.
GANDALF stops.
GANDALF
Yes, and it will not be easily cured.
(CONTINUED)
62.
 
CONTINUED:
GIMLI
Then we have run all this way for
nothing? Are we to leave those poor
Hobbits here in this horrid, dark,
dank tree-infested--?
WIDE ON: The FOREST responds to Gimli’s complaints with a low
rumble.
ANGLE ON: GIMLI stops and looks around, fearfully.
GIMLI (CONT’D)
I mean, charming...quite charming forest.
He smiles. The rumbling ceases.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns to GIMLI.
GANDALF
It was more than mere chance that
brought Merry and Pippin to Fangorn. A
great power has been sleeping here for
many long years. The coming of Merry and
Pippin will be like the falling of small
stones that starts an avalanche in the
mountains.
ARAGORN
In one thing you have not changed, dear
friend.
GANDALF leans close to ARAGORN.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)
(low)
You still speak in riddles.
They laugh.
GANDALF
A thing is about to happen that has
not happened since the Elder Days. The
Ents are going to wake up and find that
they are strong.
(CONTINUED)
63.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
GIMLI
Strong?!
(smiling nervously)
Oh, that’s good.
GANDALF
(turning to leave)
So stop your fretting, Master Dwarf.
GANDALF starts walking out of the FOREST again.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Merry and Pippin are quite safe. In
fact, they are far safer than you are
about to be.
GIMLI
(to himself)
This new Gandalf’s more grumpy than
the old one.
GIMLI trudges after the rest of the party.
EXT. BORDER OF FANGORN FOREST - DAY
ANGLE ON: GANDALF whistles piercingly. It echoes off into the
distance. He whistles again. As the echo dies out, a neigh
answers him.
ANGLE ON: A magnificent WHITE HORSE gallops towards GANDALF
over a nearby hill...GANDALF smiles.
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS, standing with ARAGORN, GIMLI and their
steeds, looks upon the approaching steed in awe.
LEGOLAS
That is one of the Mearas, unless my
eyes are cheated by some spell.
ANGLE ON: The horse gallops across the plain and comes to a stop
in front of GANDALF.
GANDALF
Shadowfax. He is the lord of all horses
...and has been my friend through many
dangers.
(CONTINUED)
64.

GANDALF walks up to SHADOWFAX and strokes his neck.

EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY
The THREE HUNTERS make haste in riding across the vast plains
to their destination at EDORAS.
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - DAY
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD continues his slow trek through the forest.
MERRY and PIPPIN remain perched in his branches - helplessly
lead along to whatever fate has in store for them.
TREEBEARD
(passionately)
O Rowan mine
I saw you shine
Upon a summer’s day
Upon your head
How golden-red
The crown you bore aloft
MERRY yawns.
TREEBEARD (CONT’D)
Such a beautiful verse.
MERRY
Is it much further?
TREEBEARD
Bru-ra-hroom. Don’t be hasty. You might
call it far, perhaps. My home lies deep
in the forest near the roots of the
mountain. I told Gandalf I would keep
you safe. And safe is where I’ll keep
you. I believe you will enjoy this next
one too. It’s one of my own
compositions. Right.
TREEBEARD clears his throat.
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN settles in to TREEBEARD and closes his eyes.
(CONTINUED)
65.
 
CONTINUED:
AERIAL: Over the mist-covered trees as the sun sets, TREEBEARD
plods along to his destination.
TREEBEARD (V.O.) (CONT’D)
Beneath the roof of sleeping leaves
And the dreams of trees unfold
When woodland halls are green and cool
And the wind is in the West
Come back to me
Come back to me
And say my land is best
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD looks over to the HOBBITS to find them
asleep.
CUT TO:
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD carefully lays the sleeping HOBBITS on the
ground.
TREEBEARD (CONT’D)
Sleep, little Shirelings. Heed no
nightly noise. Sleep till morning light.
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD stands back up and walks away, through the
forest.
TREEBEARD (CONT’D)
I have business in the forest. There
are many to call. Many that must come.
The Shadow lies on Fangorn. The
withering of all woods is drawing near.
WIDE ON: TREEBEARD slowly walks away from the HOBBITS.
EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - NIGHT
GANDALF stands on the edge of a small hill overlooking the
Plains. ARAGORN leaves the fire and joins him.
(CONTINUED)
66.
 
CONTINUED:
GANDALF
The veiling shadow that glowers in the
east takes shape. Sauron will suffer no
rival. From the summit of Barad-dûr, his
Eye watches ceaselessly. But he is not
so mighty yet that he is above fear.
Doubt ever gnaws at him. The rumor has
reached him. The heir of Númenor still
lives.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks over to GANDALF to find him already
looking into his eyes.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Sauron fears you, Aragorn. He fears
what you may become.
ARAGORN looks away, considering these words. GANDALF looks back
to the east.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
And so he’ll strike hard and fast at
the world of Men. He will use his
puppet Saruman to destroy Rohan. War
is coming. Rohan must defend itself,
and therein lies our first challenge
for Rohan is weak and ready to fall.
The king’s mind is enslaved, it’s an
old device of Saruman’s. His hold over
King Théoden is now very strong. Sauron
and Saruman are tightening the noose.
But for all their cunning, we have one
advantage.
ARAGORN and GANDALF lock eyes again.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
The Ring remains hidden.
ARAGORN nods.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
And that we should seek to destroy it
has not yet entered their darkest dreams.
(MORE)
(CONTINUED)
67.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
GANDALF (CONT’D)
And so the weapon of the enemy is moving
towards Mordor in the hands of a Hobbit.
Each day brings it closer to the fires
of Mount Doom. We must trust now in Frodo.
Everything depends upon speed and the
secrecy of his quest.
GANDALF looks over to ARAGORN and sees the worry upon his face.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Do not regret your decision to leave
him. Frodo must finish this task alone.
ARAGORN
He’s not alone. Sam went with him.
GANDALF looks over to ARAGORN, surprise alighting on his face.
GANDALF
(smiling)
Did he? Did he, indeed? Good.
He looks back to the landscape.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
Yes, very good.

quickly behind him.
SAM (CONT’D)
My old Gaffer would have a thing or
two to say if he could see us now.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM scramble up behind them.
GOLLUM
Master says to show him the way
into Mordor. So good Sméagol does,
master says so.
CLOSE ON: FRODO looks upon the GATE, wide-eyed, only now
comprehending the gravity of the request.
FRODO
I did.
INTERCUT WITH: ORCS stand guard and patrol atop the MASSIVE
BLACK GATE BATTLEMENTS.
ANGLE ON: The HOBBITS and GOLLUM looking in wonder at the Gate.
SAM’S expression drops as he turns to FRODO.
SAM
That’s it then. We can’t get past
that.

Black Gate on a path far below EPHEL DÚATH. A COMMANDER screams
orders to the TROOPS.
ANGLE ON: The THREE shrink away from the edge of the overlook.
ANGLE ON: The ARMY marches steadily towards the BLACK GATE. A
HORN SOUNDS their arrival.

ARMY.

EXT. BLACK GATE BATTLEMENTS - DAY
ANGLES ON: An ORC SOUNDS the HORN again...two enormous CAVE
TROLLS work the MECHANISM to open the mighty gate...the ORCS

SAM (CONT’D)
Look! The gate. It's opening!
HIGH WIDE ON: The BLACK GATE slowly opens to receive the

SAM (CONT’D)
I can see a way down.
SUDDENLY, THE ROCK GIVES WAY UNDER SAM AND RACES DOWN THE SIDE
OF EPHEL DÚATH WITH SAM RIDING ATOP IT!
FRODO
Sam, no!
ANGLE ON: FRODO scrambles after SAM. GOLLUM breaks from his
cowering to look up as FRODO runs off.
GOLLUM
Master!
FRODO runs and slides down the side of EPHEL DÚATH.
EXT. BASE OF EPHEL DÚATH - DAY
FRODO slides to a stop behind a rock near the bottom.
ANGLE ON: One of the EASTERLING SOLDIERS looks up at the
mountainside.
WIDE ON: A cloud of dust issues from the side of the mountain.
ANGLE ON: FRODO darts form behind one rock, slides down EPHEL
DÚATH some more and comes to rest behind another rock.
(CONTINUED)
70.

LOW ANGLE ON: The EASTERLING SOLDIERS reach the base of EPHEL
DÚATH. They survey the mountainside.
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM huddle beneath FRODO’S CLOAK, not daring
to breathe.
POV THROUGH CLOAK: One of the EASTERLINGS stands almost directly
over FRODO and SAM
They lie directly in the path of the SOLDIERS, holding their
breath. The SOLDIERS stop in front of them and look at the
mountainside.
ANGLE ON: The EASTERLING SOLDIERS look at each other for a
moment, shrug, and rejoin their party.
CLOSE ON: A ROCK in the gravel directly in front of the
EASTERLINGS’ position...the surface of the ROCK suddenly peels
back to reveal FRODO and SAM beneath it.

SUDDENLY, as they start to run, HANDS grab them from behind and
drag them to the ground.
GOLLUM
No! No! No master!
FRODO and SAM look angrily at GOLLUM. FRODO turns desperately to
the GATE.

SAM
Why haven’t you spoken of this before?!
GOLLUM
Because Master did not ask.
ANGLE ON: FRODO turns to him quickly. SAM tosses GOLLUM aside.
SAM
He’s up to something.
FRODO
Are you saying there’s another way
into Mordor?
GOLLUM
(nodding)
Yes. There’s a path...and some stairs...
and then...a tunnel.
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM watch the BLACK GATE close. GOLLUM
buries his face in FRODO’S CLOAK as FRODO turns away from his
former goal. FRODO looks at GOLLUM.
FRODO
He’s led us this far, Sam.
SAM
(desperately)
Mr. Frodo, no.

Hello?

MERRY (CONT’D)
(calling out)
Treebeard?
(to himself)
Where’s he gone?
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN sits up, holding a bowl of the water.
PIPPIN
I had the loveliest dream last
night. There was this large barrel,
full of pipe-weed. And we smoked
all of it. And then...you were sick.
(CONTINUED)
74.
 
CONTINUED:
ANGLE ON: MERRY scowls quietly...PIPPIN lies back upon the root.
PIPPIN
I’d give anything for a whiff of Old Toby.
A LOW GROAN ISSUES across the forest. The HOBBITS turn in its
direction.
MERRY
Did you hear that?
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN gathers his water pitchers...MERRY walks in
the direction of the issuing sound. Another GROAN breaks the
silence of the forest.
MERRY (CONT’D)
There it is again. Something’s not
right here. Not right at all.
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN climbs off of the root to the ground ... and
issues his own sound: an LOW GRUNT.
CLOSE ON: MERRY looks over to him, wide-eyed.
MERRY (CONT’D)
You just said something ... Treeish.
PIPPIN
No, I didn’t. I was just stretching.
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN grunts again, stretching...MERRY walks around
PIPPIN, running his eyes up and down PIPPIN.
MERRY
You’re taller.

Who?
MERRY
You!
PIPPIN
Than what?

MERRY
Than me!
PIPPIN scoffs.
PIPPIN
I’ve always been taller than you.
MERRY
(indignant)
Pippin, everyone knows I’m the
tall one. You’re the short one.
PIPPIN
Please, Merry. You’re what?
Three-foot-six? At the most?
MERRY shrugs as if to say, “Yeah.”
PIPPIN (CONT’D)
Whereas me, I’m pushing 3’7”.
Another groan issues from PIPPIN, and he grows again.
CLOSE ON: MERRY’S eyes grow wide.
PIPPIN (CONT’D)
(smiling)
3’8”!
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN happily takes another huge gulp of the water.
CLOSE ON: MERRY looks on in shock.

brook...MERRY looks at the water, and then snatches the
water jug and takes a huge drink.

Merry don’t! Don’t drink it!
MERRY takes off with the jug. PIPPIN chases him. He takes
another drink, pushing PIPPIN away.
PIPPIN (CONT’D)
Merry! No, Treebeard said that you
shouldn’t have any.
PIPPIN tries to grab MERRY again, but MERRY pushes him away and
runs off to take another drink.
MERRY
I want some!
PIPPIN
It could well be dangerous!
ANGLE ON: MERRY leads PIPPIN across some large tree roots.
PIPPIN (CONT’D)
Give me it back. Merry!
SUDDENLY, MERRY slips between two of the roots, and the tree
groans and moves.
CLOSE ON: It closes its roots to traps the ankles of both
HOBBITS.
PIPPIN (CONT’D)
What’s happening!
MERRY
It’s got my leg!
SERIES OF CUTS: The TREE moves its roots to traps the HOBBITS’
limbs.
PIPPIN
Merry!
ANGLE ON: The tree pulls them into its roots as others close in
over them.

Disturbed leaves from above cover the HOBBITS, making them
virtually invisible as they scream. The roots finish the job and
completely bury the HOBBITS.
PIPPIN (CONT’D)
(muffled)
Help!
WIDE ON: Silence fills the air as the scene looks serene - as
if nothing sinister happened at all.
ON THE SOUNDTRACK: Large footfalls ECHO.
TREEBEARD quickly approaches the tree.
TREEBEARD
Away with you. You should not be
waking. Eat earth. Dig deep. Drink
water.
ANGLES ON: The roots move again, releasing the HOBBITS. With
desperate cries, they free themselves from the tree’s grasp.
TREEBEARD (CONT’D)
Go to sleep. Away with you.
The HOBBITS shake off the leaves and stand by TREEBEARD,
looking back at the tree roots in horror.
TREEBEARD (CONT’D)

isn’t safe.
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD lifts the HOBBITS, one in each hand, and

ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD travels through the FOREST again, carrying
the HOBBITS on his shoulders.

CONTINUED:
TREEBEARD (CONT’D)
The trees have grown wild and
dangerous. Anger festers in their
hearts. Black are their thoughts.
Strong is their hate. They will
harm you if they can. There are too
few of us now. Too few of us Ents
left to manage them.
PIPPIN
Why are there so few of you when you
have lived so long? Are there Ent
children?
TREEBEARD
Bru-ra-hroom. There have been no Entings
for a terrible long count of years.
MERRY
Why is that?
TREEBEARD
We lost the Entwives.
PIPPIN
Oh, I’m sorry. How did they die?
TREEBEARD
Die? No. We lost them. And now we
cannot find them. I don’t suppose
you’ve seen Entwives in the Shire?
MERRY
(hesitantly)
Can’t say that I have. You, Pip?
ANGLE ON: PIPPIN stares off blankly, and then shakes his head.
PIPPIN
What do they look like?

ANGLE ON: A shadow moves in the hall behind her. She pays it no
mind. WORMTONGUE appears at the door. He looks upon her,
concerned.
WORMTONGUE
Oh, he must have died sometime in the
night. What a tragedy for the king to
lose his only son and heir.
He sits on the bed and puts a hand on ÉOWYN’S shoulder.
WORMTONGUE (CONT’D)
I understand. His passing is hard to
accept. Especially now that your brother
has deserted you.
ÉOWYN jumps up and throws off his hand.
EÓWYN
Leave me alone, snake!
She backs away from him. WORMTONGUE rises and moves over to her.
WORMTONGUE
(suddenly sinister)
Oh, but you are alone. Who knows what
you’ve spoken to the darkness in the
bitter watches of the night when all
your life seems to shrink. The walls of
your bower closing in about you. A hutch
to trammel some wild thing in.
(CONTINUED)
81.
 
CONTINUED:
He stops in front of her and stares into her eyes. She seems
transfixed by him. He puts a hand on the side of her face as he
speaks.
WORMTONGUE (CONT’D)
So fair, so cold. Like a morning pale
spring still clinging to winter's chill.
She closes her eyes as if affected by his words. He moves his
hand to her throat.
CLOSE ON: She suddenly opens her eyes and looks through him.
ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE starts back away.

(angrily)
Your words are poison.
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN abruptly leaves the room. WORMTONGUE appears
taken aback by the sudden change in her.
EXT. MEDUSELD - DAY
ÉOWYN throws open the main doors and charges outside. She walks
to the brink of the porch outside the hall and looks far-off
into the distance, as if hoping to find someone there. She walks

across the city.

weapons.

allow the Four to enter behind him.

(labored)
Why should I welcome you, Gandalf
Stormcrow?
He looks to WORMTONGUE for affirmation, who nods.
WORMTONGUE
A just question, my liege.
WORMTONGUE stands before them. He walks to meet them well in
front of THÉODEN.

Late is the hour in which this conjurer

GANDALF
Be silent.

GANDALF (CONT’D)
Keep your forked tongue behind your
teeth. I have not passed through fire
and death to bandy crooked words with a
witless worm.
He raises his staff to WORMTONGUE. WORMTONGUE back away from
it.
WORMTONGUE
His staff.
He backs well away from GANDALF while addressing the guards,
arrogantly.

I told you to take the wizard’s
staff.

You have no power here, Gandalf the

spreads his hands. A blinding white light issues from him.
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN is thrown back against his seat.
GANDALF
I will draw you, Saruman, as poison is
drawn from a wound.
He thrusts his staff towards THÉODEN. The force knocks THÉODEN
back in his throne. GANDALF moves in closer.

No, my lord! No, my lord. Let him go.
Enough blood has been spilt on his

There is no way out of that ravine.
Théoden is walking into a trap. He thinks
he’s leading them to safety. What they
will get is a massacre.
CLOSE ON: GANDALF turns to ARAGORN.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
(grim)
Théoden has a strong will, but I fear for
him. I fear for the survival of Rohan. He
will need you before the end, Aragorn.
The people of Rohan will need you. The
defenses have to hold.
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN holds GANDALF’S gaze resolutely.
ARAGORN
They will hold.
ANGLE ON: GANDALF turns from ARAGORN to SHADOWFAX. Gently, he
strokes the mighty horse’s coat.
GANDALF
(musing)
The Grey Pilgrim. That’s what they used
to call me. Three hundred lives of Men
I’ve walked this earth, and now I have
no time.

SHADOWFAX.

struggle...he puts down his saddle and walks to them.
SOLDIER
That horse is half mad, my lord.
There’s nothing you can do. Leave
him.
ANGLE ON: BREGO rears and whinnies as ARAGORN comes closer.
ARAGORN

Fæste, stille nú...fæste...
Fast, be quiet now...fast...
ARAGORN signals one of the SOLDIERS to go...

ARAGORN slowly reaches BREGO...he caresses the beast’s coat...
carefully, he removes the ropes detaining BREGO...he hands them
to the other SOLDIER...ÉOWYN watches with wonder.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)
(in OLD ENGLISH)
Hwæt nemnað ðe? Hm? Hwæt nemnað ðe?
What is your name? Hm? What is your
name?
ÉOWYN
His name is Brego.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN snaps around to look at ÉOWYN.
ÉOWYN (CONT’D)
He was my cousin’s horse.
ARAGORN
Brego.
(to BREGO; in OLD ENGLISH)
Ðin nama is cynglic. 
Your name is kingly.
CLOSE ON: ÉOWYN moves slowly to ARAGORN as he speaks,
transfixed.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)

Man le trasta, Brego? Man cenich?

you see?

ÉOWYN
I have heard of the magic of Elves, but
I did not look for it in a Ranger from
the North. You speak as one of their own.
ARAGORN
I was raised in Rivendell ... for a

enough of war.
ARAGORN leaves BREGO with ÉOWYN...he retrieves his saddle and
leaves.

INT. PALANTÍR CHAMBER, ORTHANC - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN paces the chamber mulling over his loss to
GANDALF.
SARUMAN
Gandalf the White. Gandalf the Fool!
Does he seek to humble me with his
newfound piety?
ANGLE ON: WORMTONGUE enters slowly and moves to SARUMAN...
SARUMAN stands suddenly still, a look of disgust crossing his
face.
WORMTONGUE
There were three who followed the
wizard. An Elf, a Dwarf, and a Man.
SARUMAN sniffs.
SARUMAN
You stink of horse.
WORMTONGUE shrinks back and walks away...

SARUMAN (CONT’D)

WORMTONGUE
No, from the North. One of the Dúnedain
Rangers, I thought he was.
CLOSE ON: SARUMAN suddenly shows much interest.
WORMTONGUE (CONT’D)
His cloth was poor. And yet he bore
a strange ring. Two serpents with
emerald eyes. One devouring, the other
crowned with golden flowers.

CLOSE ON: A BOOK opens to a page showing a picture of the very
ring WORMTONGUE described.
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN sits back in his chair...WORMTONGUE stands
behind him at the door.
SARUMAN
The Ring of Barahir. So Gandalf Greyhame
thinks he has found Isildur’s heir. The
lost king of Gondor. He is a fool. The
line was broken years ago.
CLOSE ON: SARUMAN closes his book and pushes it aside.
SARUMAN (CONT’D)
It matters not. The world of Men shall

This is not a defeat.
GAMLING turns to him...

GAMLING bows to him and exits.

ROHIRRIM gather things from the Great Hall and carry it out.
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN opens a chest and pulls out a sheathed sword...
she unsheathes it and holds it before her, running her hand down
the flat side of the blade, smiling...deliberately, she
practices her swing.
POV: Someone approaches from behind...she swings it behind her!
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN meets her swing with his DAGGER. ÉOWYN’S face
does not soften at his gaze.
ARAGORN
You have some skill with a blade.
With a swift move, ÉOWYN swings her sword, throwing ARAGORN’S
arm and knife to one side, rendering him vulnerable and
gaining the upper hand...
He lowers his weapon...she does likewise and steps away.

ÉOWYN
Women of this country learned long ago:
those without swords may still die upon
them. I fear neither death nor pain.
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN re-sheathes the sword...she replaces it in the
chest.
ARAGORN
What do you fear, my lady?
CLOSE ON: She freezes for a moment...she turns to him.
ÉOWYN
(gravely)
A cage. To stay behind bars until use
and old age accept them. And all chance
of valor has gone beyond recall or
desire.
CLOSE ON: ARAGORN shakes his head in wonder.
ARAGORN
You’re a daughter of kings, a
shieldmaiden of Rohan.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN sheathes his knife...he continues to look at
her.

Théoden will not stay at Edoras.
INTERCUT WITH: SARUMAN patiently listens to WORMTONGUE in
ORTHANC.
WORMTONGUE (CONT’D)
It’s vulnerable. He knows this. He will
expect an attack on the city. They will
flee to Helm’s Deep, the great fortress
of Rohan.
ANGLES ON: The ROHIRRIM make their way towards the mountains
where HELM’S DEEP lies...some falter...some ride in carts...ever
so slowly, they draw closer to their destination.
WORMTONGUE (V.O.) (CONT’D)
It is a dangerous road to take through
the mountains. They will be slow.
INSERT IMAGE: WORMTONGUE speaks to SARUMAN in ORTHANC.

GOLLUM grasps at it desperately causing him to slide downstream.
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM come over the rise behind him.
SAM
Hey, stinker, don’t go getting too far
ahead!
FRODO
Why do you do that?
SAM stops and turns to FRODO.
SAM
What?
FRODO
Call him names. Run him down all the
time.
SAM
Because. Because that's what he is, Mr.
Frodo. There's naught left in him but
lies and deceit. It's the Ring he wants.
It's all he cares about.
FRODO
(angrily)
You have no idea what it did to him...
what it's still doing to him.
He pushes past SAM and stops.
FRODO (CONT’D)
I want to help him, Sam.
SAM
Why?
POV: GOLLUM looks about for the fish...slowly, he realises it is
lost...he looks up at FRODO and smiles.

ANGLE ON: FRODO’S eyes dart to the side away from GOLLUM,
worried.
FRODO
Because I have to believe he can come
back.
SAM
You can’t save him, Mr. Frodo.
FRODO
(spinning to SAM; angrily)
What do you know about it? Nothing!
SAM is taken aback. Slowly, he walks past FRODO. FRODO turns to
him.
FRODO (CONT’D)
I'm sorry, Sam. I don't know why I
said that.
SAM turns back to FRODO.
SAM
(gently)
I do. It's the Ring. You can't take your
eyes off it! I've seen you. You're not
eating. You barely sleep. It's taken hold
of you, Mr. Frodo. You have to fight it.
CLOSE ON: FRODO’S eyes flare again...
FRODO
(angrily)
I know what I have to do Sam. The Ring
was entrusted to me. It's my task. Mine!
My own!
FRODO storms away. SAM turns to him, shocked.
SAM
Can't you hear yourself? Don't you know
who you sound like?
FRODO continues walking without turning back.

SAM and FRODO sleep.

GOLLUM
We wants it. We needs it.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM watches them from a distance...hatred is etched
across his face.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Must have the precious. They stole it
from us. Sneaky little Hobbitses.
Wicked. Tricksy. False.
Suddenly, his expression softens, and he shakes his head. His
eyes grow wide, as if looking at his GOLLUM half.
SMÉAGOL
No. Not Master.
His expression turns to hate again. His head turns as if
responding to the SMÉAGOL half.
GOLLUM
Yes, precious. False. They will
cheat you, hurt you, lie!
SMÉAGOL
Master’s my friend.
GOLLUM
(taunting)
You don’t have any friends. Nobody
likes you.
SMÉAGOL
Not listening. I’m not listening.
GOLLUM
You’re a liar and a thief.

GOLLUM
Murderer.
SMÉAGOL sniffles.
SMÉAGOL
Go away.
GOLLUM
Go away?
GOLLUM laughs at the very notion. SMÉAGOL acts as if the
exchange stresses him. He holds his head and speaks in a small
voice.
SMÉAGOL
I hate you. I hate you.
GOLLUM
(fiercely)
Where would you be without me?
(coughing)
Gollum. Gollum. I saved us. It was me.
We survived because of me.
SMÉAGOL raises his head and looks at GOLLUM.
SMÉAGOL
Not anymore.
GOLLUM

What did you say?
SMÉAGOL

GOLLUM growls and bares his teeth.

SMÉAGOL looks scared for a moment. GOLLUM does not respond. He
looks around quickly, desperately. A smile breaks on his face.
SMÉAGOL (CONT’D)
We told him to go away. And away he
goes, precious.
He leaps from where he was sitting and dances about.
SMÉAGOL (CONT’D)

Gone! Gone! Gone! Sméagol is free!

GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Look. Look. See what Sméagol finds?
ANGLES ON: GOLLUM smiles deliriously, and then jumps around
laughing proudly...FRODO smiles at GOLLUM and looks over to
SAM...SAM is not so amused...GOLLUM raises a triumphant fist to
conclude his happy little dance. He picks up one of the CONEYS.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
They are young.

He snaps the Coney’s back. FRODO cringes, disgusted with this
particular display.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
They are tender. They are nice. Yes,
they are. Eat them. Eat them!
ANGLES ON: Disgusted, SAM walks over to GOLLUM...GOLLUM digs his
teeth into his CONEY ripping a large chunk of raw meat out of
it.
SAM
You’ll make him sick, you will...
SAM snatches the CONEY from GOLLUM’S hands, tossing him to one
side.
SAM (CONT’D)

SAM holds up the CONEYS.

There’s only one way to eat a brace of

stirring.

GOLLUM

What’s taters, precious? What’s taters?
Eh?
ANGLE ON: The calling sound continues...FRODO starts walking,
searching for its source.
SAM
(impatiently)
Po-ta-toes. Boil them, mash them, stick
them in a stew. Lovely big golden chips
with a nice piece of fried fish.
GOLLUM spits at the very thought. SAM looks to him, proud of his
imagery.
SAM (CONT’D)
Even you couldn’t say no to that.
GOLLUM
(indignant)
Oh, yes, we could. Spoil a nice fish.
He scrambles up close to SAM.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Give it to us raw and wriggling. You
keep nasty chips.

stew...GOLLUM hops away. SAM shakes his head.
SAM
You’re hopeless.
He sips the stew.

gathering all armies to him. It won’t be
long now. He will soon be ready.
SAM
Ready to do what?
GOLLUM
To make his war. The last war that will
cover all the world in Shadow.
FRODO
We’ve got to get moving. Come on, Sam.
FRODO starts to leave...SUDDENLY, SAM grabs Frodo’s arm,

FARAMIR (CONT’D)
You wonder what his name is, where he
came from. And if he was really evil at
heart. What lies or threats led him on
this long march from home. If he would
not rather have stayed there...in peace.
He breaks from his reflection and turns back to FRODO.

GIMLI to the dirt...ÉOWYN rushes forward to GIMLI who struggles

deliberate. It was deliberate.
ÉOWYN helps GIMLI to his feet.
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN and ARAGORN, riding side by side, laugh at
the sight...THÉODEN glances at ARAGORN.

POV: ÉOWYN laughs and looks to him as she brushes GIMLI off.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks back to THÉODEN.

ARAGORN. He looks up at her approach.
ÉOWYN
I made some stew. It isn’t much, but
it’s hot.
She draws him a bowl, and he takes it. She hands him a spoon.
ARAGORN
Thank you.
CLOSE ON: He dips the spoon in the bowl and fishes for a bite of
meat.
Immediately upon putting the morsel into his mouth, he
freezes...his face registers the distaste of this morsel...
meekly, he looks up to ÉOWYN...he swallows hard, and nods with

My uncle told me a strange thing. He
said that you rode to war with Thengel,
my grandfather. But he must be mistaken.
ARAGORN
King Théoden has a good memory. He was
only a small child at the time.

ÉOWYN
Then you must be at least 60.

ÉOWYN (CONT’D)
Seventy?
ARAGORN looks down and still doesn’t respond.
ÉOWYN (CONT’D)
But you cannot be 80!

ARWEN
There is still hope.
ELROND walks toward the window and looks away from her.
ELROND
If Aragorn survives this war, you will
still be parted. If Sauron is defeated

hope for comes true, you will still have
to taste the bitterness of mortality.
Whether by the sword or the slow decay of
time, Aragorn will die.

GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
It works hard now to find its way back
into the hands of Men. Men, who are so
easily seduced by its power.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR, leading the band of RANGERS.
GALADRIEL (V.O.) (CONT’D)
The young captain of Gondor has but
to extend his hands, take the Ring

hideout of the RANGERS, HENNETH ANNÛN.

What news?
MADRIL
Our scouts report Saruman has

MADRIL (CONT’D)
Théoden’s people have fled to Helm’s
Deep. But we must look to our own
borders.

MAP.

fronts. Gondor is weak.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
Sauron will strike us soon. And he will
strike hard.
CLOSE ON: The MAP closes in on OSGILIATH.

RANGERS, all walking to and fro in their duties.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR enters and address FRODO and SAM.
FARAMIR
My Men tell me that you are Orc
spies.
SAM
Spies?! Now wait just a minute!
FARAMIR
Well if you’re not spies, then who
are you?
SAM looks over to FRODO, who remains silent and unmoving...
FARAMIR sits to address them.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
Speak.
FRODO and SAM stay silent for a moment...finally, FRODO speaks.
FRODO
We are Hobbits of the Shire. Frodo
Baggins is my name, and this is Samwise
Gamgee.
FARAMIR
Your bodyguard?
SAM
(insulted)
His gardener.
FARAMIR
And where is your skulking friend?
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks suddenly nervous, his eyes widening.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
That gangrel creature. He had an illfavored
look.
(CONTINUED)

FRODO shakes his head.
FRODO
There was no other.
ANGLE ON: SAM looks uncomfortable, as if caught in a lie...
FARAMIR eyes them suspiciously.
FRODO (CONT’D)
We set out from Rivendell with seven
companions.
FARAMIR is suddenly very interested.
FRODO (CONT’D)
One we lost in Moria, two were my kin, a
Dwarf there was also, and an Elf. And two
Men, Aragorn, son of Arathorn, and
Boromir of Gondor.
FARAMIR’S expression changes to that of reserved surprise.
FARAMIR
(intently)
You’re a friend of Boromir?
FRODO
Yes... for my part.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR turns away from the HOBBITS for a moment, and
then back to address them.
FARAMIR
It would grieve you then to learn that
he was dead.
CLOSE ON: FRODO’S mouth drops, shocked.
FRODO
Dead? How? When?
FARAMIR
As one of his companions, I hoped you
would tell me.
(CONTINUED)
146.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
FRODO
If something has happened to Boromir, we
would have you tell us.
FARAMIR
(with great difficulty)
His horn washed up on the riverbank,
about six days past. It was cloven in
two. But more than this, I know it in my
heart. He was my brother.
CLOSE ON: FRODO stands speechless at the revelation.
IMAGES: FARAMIR stands alone on a riverbank...FARAMIR walks
through the water to an ELVEN BOAT, floating down the river.
IMAGE: CLOSE ON the ELVEN BOAT: BOROMIR lies in state.

him by.

Hundreds of GONDORIANS crowd the streets of the city, crying
BOROMIR’S name.
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR plants a flag in one of the turrets and draws

This city was once the jewel of our
kingdom...a place of light and beauty
and music...and so it shall be once
more!
(CONTINUED)
147.
 
CONTINUED:
The people cheer in response.
BOROMIR (CONT’D)
Let the armies of Mordor know this:
never again will the land of my
people fall into enemy hands.
The people cheer again.
BOROMIR (CONT’D)
This city of Osgiliath has been
reclaimed for Gondor!
WIDE ON: BOROMIR raises his sword in triumph over the city. The
people respond to him with cheers and jubilation.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR makes his way through the crowds to BOROMIR.
They embrace.
FARAMIR
Good speech. Nice and short.

Leaves more time for drinking!
The brothers laughs. BOROMIR addresses the people around him.
BOROMIR (CONT’D)
Break out the ale! These men are
thirsty!
The men cheer in agreement.
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR fills two tankards of ale. He hands one to
FARAMIR and they toast.
BOROMIR (CONT’D)
Remember today, little brother. Today,
life is good.
They drink...FARAMIR’S gaze drifts beyond BOROMIR. His
expression drops.
BOROMIR (CONT’D)
What?
(CONTINUED)
148.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
FARAMIR
He’s here.
BOROMIR turns.
ANGLE ON: LORD DENETHOR, their father and the STEWARD OF
GONDOR, makes his way through the crowd, happily greeting the
people.
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR, turns away in frustration.
BOROMIR (CONT’D)
One moment of peace, can he not give
us that?
DENETHOR
(smiling broadly)
Where is he? Where is Gondor’s finest?
Where’s my first-born?
BOROMIR musters a smile, and then turns to greet DENETHOR.
BOROMIR
Father!
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR drops back, as if staying out of the way...
BOROMIR embraces DENETHOR.
DENETHOR
They say you vanquished the enemy
almost single-handedly.
BOROMIR
They exaggerate. The victory belongs
to Faramir also.
FARAMIR smiles and steps forward...DENETHOR scowls.
DENETHOR
(condescending)
But for Faramir, this city would still
be standing. Were you not entrusted to
protect it?
FARAMIR
I would have done, but our numbers
were too few.
(CONTINUED)
149.
 
CONTINUED: (3)
DENETHOR
Oh, too few. You let the enemy walk in
and take it on a whim.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR is shattered, hurt by his father’s
condescension. DENETHOR steps toward him for the kill.
DENETHOR (CONT’D)
Always you cast a poor reflection on
me.
FARAMIR
That is not my intent.
BOROMIR
(impatient)
You give him no credit, and yet he
tries do to your will.
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR storms away. DENETHOR leaves FARAMIR and
follows him.
BOROMIR (CONT’D)
He loves you, Father.
DENETHOR
Do not trouble me with Faramir ... I
know his uses, and they are few.
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR turns away, unbelieving a father would say
such things of a son.
DENETHOR (CONT’D)
We have more urgent things to speak
of. Elrond of Rivendell has called
a meeting. He will not say why, but
I have guessed its purpose. It is
rumored that the weapon of the enemy
has been found.
CLOSE ON: BOROMIR’S mouth DROPS in SURPRISE and DISBELIEF.
BOROMIR
(delicately)
The One Ring ... Isildur’s Bane.
(CONTINUED)
150.
 
CONTINUED: (4)
DENETHOR
It has fallen into the hands of the
Elves. Everyone will try to claim it:
Men, Dwarves, wizards. We cannot let
that happen. This thing must come to
Gondor.
BOROMIR
Gondor.
DENETHOR
It’s dangerous, I know. Ever the Ring
will seek to corrupt the hearts of
lesser Men. But you, you are strong...
and our need is great. It is our blood
which is being spilled, our people who
are dying. Sauron is biding his time.
He’s massing fresh armies. He will
return. And when he does, we will be
powerless to stop him. You must go.
Bring me back this mighty gift.
ANGLE ON: BOROMIR pulls away from DENETHOR and proceeds back
out into OSGILIATH.
BOROMIR
No. My place is here with my people.
Not in Rivendell
ANGLE ON: DENETHOR chases BOROMIR out.
DENETHOR
Would you deny your own father?
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR steps forward.
FARAMIR
If there is a need to go to Rivendell,
send me in his stead.
ANGLE ON: DENETHOR looks at FARAMIR with a cruel sneer.
DENETHOR
You? Oh, I see. A chance for Faramir,
captain of Gondor, to show his
quality. I think not.
(CONTINUED)
151.
 
CONTINUED: (5)
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR’S confident expression drops.
DENETHOR (CONT’D)
I trust this mission only to your
brother. The one who will not fail me.

OSGILIATH.

FARAMIR eyes him watchfully.
ANGLE ON: Far below, GOLLUM jumps into the pool at the base of
the waterfall.
ANGLE ON: FRODO’S eyes open wide, as if caught in his lie.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
(calmly)
To enter the Forbidden Pool bears
the penalty of death.
FRODO looks at FARAMIR with fear. FARAMIR gestures to the sides
of the waterfall...ARCHERS stationed on both sides of the pool
lean in and draw their bows...FRODO looks back to GOLLUM.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
They wait for my command.
ANGLE ON: Far below, GOLLUM emerges from the pool with a fish in
his teeth and sits on a rock.

their bows.
ANGLE ON: FRODO continues watching GOLLUM, indecision etched
across his face.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM attempts to eat the fish, but it wriggles about
in his grasp. He regains control of the fish and whacks it
repeatedly on the rock.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR raises his hand to give the signal to fire.
FRODO
Wait!
FARAMIR stops. He continues looking at FRODO expectantly.
FRODO (CONT’D)
(with difficulty)
This creature is bound to me. And I to
him.
FARAMIR lowers his hand and responds, knowing GOLLUM is
connected to FRODO.
FRODO (CONT’D)
He is our guide.
(desperately)
Please ... let me go down to him.
FARAMIR nods. FRODO runs off.
EXT. THE FORBIDDEN POOL - NIGHT
GOLLUM tears at the fish. FRODO appears from behind him.
FRODO (CONT’D)

GOLLUM continues eating, not responding to FRODO’S call.
FRODO (CONT’D)
Master is here.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM turns to FRODO, hesitantly.
FRODO (CONT’D)
Come, Sméagol. Trust master. Come!
GOLLUM doesn’t move. He looks at FRODO distrustfully.
GOLLUM
We must go now?
FRODO
Sméagol, you must trust master. Follow
me, come on. Come.
GOLLUM finally responds to FRODO. He puts the fish between his
teeth and follows warily after FRODO.
FRODO (CONT’D)
Come Sméagol. Nice Sméagol. That’s it.
Come on.
ANGLE ON: FRODO stops. GOLLUM’S eyes dart around, fearfully.
SUDDENLY! A GONDORIAN RANGER grabs GOLLUM by the neck, lifting
him off the ground. Instantly, several others descend on him,
quickly overpowering him. GOLLUM wails in anguish.
FRODO (CONT’D)
Don’t hurt him! Sméagol don’t
struggle! Sméagol listen to me!
GOLLUM
Master!
A BLACK CLOTH is draped over GOLLUM’S head. The RANGERS pack

to them.
FARAMIR
That’s enough.
ANGLE ON: The MEN throw GOLLUM to the ground. He scrambles into
a corner. FARAMIR approaches him.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
Where are you leading them?
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM cowers away from him, whimpering.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
Answer me!
GOLLUM continues sobbing. Suddenly, his hand starts stroking his
shoulder, comfortingly.
GOLLUM
Sméagol. Why does it cry, Sméagol?
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR looks upon GOLLUM, confused.
SMÉAGOL
(sobbing)
Cruel Men hurts us. Master tricksed us.
GOLLUM
Of course he did.
SMÉAGOL sobs again.
GOLLUM
I told you he was tricksy. I told you he

GOLLUM
Filthy little Hobbitses. They stole
it from us!
SMÉAGOL

No ... No.

I can’t. You were right, Sam. You tried
to tell me but ... I’m sorry. The Ring’s
taking me, Sam.
(fearfully)
If I put it on, he’ll find me. He’ll
see.
SAM
Mr. Frodo...
SAM suddenly looks up.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR enters and draws his sword. The HOBBITS jump
up and stand before him.
FARAMIR
So this is the answer to all the riddles
... here in the Wild I have you. Two
halflings ... and a host of Men at my
call.
FARAMIR backs FRODO up against a wall, his sword at FRODO’S
neck.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
The Ring of Power within my grasp.
CLOSE ON: FARAMIR lifts the RING from FRODO'S tunic with the tip

reels on FARAMIR.
SAM
(angrily)
Stop it! Leave him alone! Don’t you
understand? He’s got to destroy it!
That’s where we’re going ... into
Mordor ... to the mountain of fire.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR, unmoving, continues to stare at FRODO. MADRIL
enters behind him, snapping him out of his trance.
MADRIL
Osgiliath is under attack. They call for
reinforcements.
SAM
Please. It’s such a burden. Will you not
help him?
MADRIL
Captain?
FARAMIR

THÉODEN turns to ARAGORN, incredulous.

EXT. HELM’S DEEP BATTLEMENTS - DAY
WIDE ON: THÉODEN leads ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, and GIMLI across the
battlements of HELM’S DEEP, overlooking the expansive plains.
THÉODEN (CONT’D)
They will break upon this fortress
like water on rock. Saruman’s hordes
will pillage and burn. We’ve seen it
before. Crops can be resown; homes
rebuilt. Within these walls, we will
outlast them.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN follows THÉODEN closely.
ARAGORN
They do not come to destroy Rohan’s
crops or villages. They come to
destroy its people ... down to the
last child.
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN turns quickly to ARAGORN and draws him close.
THÉODEN
(quietly; angrily)
What would you have me do? Look at my
Men. Their courage hangs by a thread.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks away ashamed.
THÉODEN (CONT’D)
If this is to be our end, then I would
have them make such an end as to be
worthy of remembrance.
THÉODEN walks away. ARAGORN pleads with THÉODEN.
ARAGORN
Send out riders, my lord. You must
call for aid.
THÉODEN turns back ARAGORN, drawing close again.
THÉODEN
(doubtfully)
And who will come? Elves? Dwarves?
We are not so lucky in our friends
as you. The old alliances are dead.
(CONTINUED)
164.
 
CONTINUED:
ARAGORN
Gondor will answer.
THÉODEN
(angrily)
Gondor?! Where was Gondor when the
Westfold fell? Where was Gondor when
our enemies closed in around us?! Where
was Gon--?
THÉODEN recollects himself. He looks into ARAGORN’S eyes.
THÉODEN (CONT’D)
(quietly)
No, my Lord Aragorn...we are alone.
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN turns away again...ARAGORN looks after him,
nodding...THÉODEN walks up the steps to the HALL, followed
closely by GAMLING.
THÉODEN (CONT’D)
Get the women and children into the
caves.
GAMLING
We need more time to lay provisions--
THÉODEN
(curt)
There is no time. War is upon us.
THÉODEN and STAFF enter into the HALL...HIGH OVERHEAD, a flock
of crows gathers.
EXT. FANGORN FOREST - DAY

rest in his branches, carried along by their fates.

wars of Men and wizards for a very long
time.

that has not happened for an age ...
Entmoot.
MERRY
What’s that?
TREEBEARD
'Tis a gathering.
MERRY
A gathering of what?
A noise sounds from behind them.
ANGLE ON: MERRY turns to look behind TREEBEARD.
ANGLES ON: ENTS begin emerging from the forest and walking
towards TREEBEARD.
OVERHEAD ANGLE ON: Many ENTS walk to the middle of the gathering
where TREEBEARD awaits.
TREEBEARD
Beech. Oak. Chestnut. Ash. Good. Good.
Good. Many have come.
ANGLES ON: The ENTS all stop near TREEBEARD...MERRY and PIPPIN
look about in awe.
TREEBEARD (CONT’D)
Now we must decide if the Ents will
go to war.
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN look to TREEBEARD in fear and
anticipation.
EXT. HELM’S DEEP COURTYARD - DAY
ANGLES ON: In a mass organized movement, the people gather their
belongings and trudge together into hiding. SOLDIERS assist the
elderly and infirm in getting themselves into the caves.

the plan to LEGOLAS.

166.
 
CONTINUED:
ARAGORN
We’ll place the reserves along the wall.
They can support the archers from above
the gate.
LEGOLAS
Aragorn, you must rest. You’re no use
to us half alive.
ARAGORN pays LEGOLAS no mind. A VOICE breaks across the
throngs. ARAGORN looks in its direction.
ÉOWYN (O.S.)
Aragorn! Aragorn!
ANGLE ON: ÉOWYN runs through the crowds towards him. She looks
at him angrily.
ÉOWYN (CONT’D)
I’m to be sent with the women into
the caves.
ARAGORN
(nodding)
That is an honorable charge.
ÉOWYN
To mind the children, to find food and
bedding with the men return. What
renown is there in that?
ARAGORN grasps her hands.
ARAGORN
(reassuring)
My lady, a time may come for valor
without renown. Who then will your
people look to in the last defense?
ÉOWYN
(pleading)
Let me stand at your side.
ARAGORN
It is not in my power to command it.
(CONTINUED)
167.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
ARAGORN turns away from her. She looks after him unmoved. He
turns.
ÉOWYN
You do not command the others to stay!
They fight beside you because they
would not be parted from you.
(desperately)
Because they love you!
ARAGORN stands before her, looking at her silently. She averts
her gaze.
ÉOWYN (CONT’D)
I’m sorry.
She pushes past him and follows the people into the caves.
INT. HELM’S DEEP CAVES - NIGHT
ANGLE ON: WOMEN and CHILDREN comfort each other as they trudge
their way into the caves...They regard their new home with fear
and doubt...ÉOWYN studies her task grimly.
WIDE ON: The expansiveness of the caves holds thousands of
ROHIRRIM. The caves seem to go on forever.
ANGLES ON: Tearful good-byes from wives, mothers, young siblings
and children as even old men and boys are drafted into service
and taken away from their families to fight.
ANGLES ON: Swords are passed out to the miserable army.
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN examines one of the swords. He tosses it away,
discouraged.
ARAGORN
Farmer, farriers, stable boys. These are
no soldiers.
GIMLI
Most have seen too many winters.
LEGOLAS
Or too few.
(CONTINUED)
168.
 
CONTINUED:
ARAGORN nods, miserably.
ANGLES ON: The new soldiers continue to prepare.
LEGOLAS (CONT’D)
Look at them. They’re frightened. I
can see it in their eyes.
ANGLE ON: Everyone around them turns to look at LEGOLAS. He
turns away, angrily.
LEGOLAS (CONT’D)
(in ELVISH; subtitled)
Boe a hûn...neled herain...dan caer

And they should be...Three hundred
...against ten thousand!
ANGLE ON: ARAGORN looks at LEGOLAS with as much confidence as he
can muster.
ARAGORN
(in ELVISH; subtitled)
Si beriathar hýn. Amar nâ ned Edoras.
(subtitled)
They have more hope of defending
themselves here than at Edoras.
LEGOLAS
Aragorn, Men i ndagor. Hýn ú-...
ortheri. Natha daged aen!
Aragorn, we are warriors. They
cannot win this fight. They are all
going to die!
ARAGORN explodes at LEGOLAS.
ARAGORN
(resolute)
Then I shall die as one them!
Their gaze locks for a moment...ARAGORN breaks and walks away.
LEGOLAS makes to follow him...GIMLI puts a hand on his arm.
GIMLI
Let him go, lad. Let him be.
169.
 
EXT. HELM’S DEEP - NIGHT

GAMLING approaches KING THÉODEN.
GAMLING
Every villager able to wield a
sword has been sent to the armory.
THÉODEN stands silently - unarmed and armourless.
GAMLING (CONT’D)
My lord?
THÉODEN
(quietly)
Who am I, Gamling?
GAMLING
(matter-of-fact)
You are our king, sire.
THÉODEN
(quietly)
And do you trust your king?
GAMLING stands at THÉODEN’S side with his armour, unmoving.
GAMLING
Your men, my lord, will follow you
to whatever end.
Slowly, GAMLING wraps the armour around THÉODEN.
THÉODEN
(quietly, to himself)
To whatever end...

It’s been going for hours.
PIPPIN stands and walks over to him.
PIPPIN
They must have decided something by
now.
TREEBEARD turns to them and shakes his head.
TREEBEARD
Decided? No.
Slowly, TREEBEARD turns to the HOBBITS.
TREEBEARD (CONT’D)
We only just finished saying...good
morning.
TREEBEARD turns back to the ENTMOOT.
ANGLE ON: MERRY looks on in frustration.
MERRY
But it’s nighttime already. You can’t
take forever.

holding a sword. He looks at ARAGORN briefly and averts his
gaze.
ARAGORN
Give me your sword.
ANGLE ON: The boy whips around, looking at ARAGORN. Slowly, he
walks over to ARAGORN and hands over his sword. ARAGORN takes
it.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)
What is your name?
HALETH
Haleth, son of Háma, my lord.
ARAGORN reacts to the name.
HALETH (CONT’D)
The Men are saying that we will not
live out the night. They say that it is
hopeless...
Wordlessly, ARAGORN stands and eyeballs the sword. He gives it a
few swings and holds it before him. He looks at HALETH.
ARAGORN
This is a good sword.
ARAGORN hands the sword back to HALETH, who takes it gingerly.
ARAGORN (CONT’D)
Haleth, son of Háma...

wrong to despair.

There is nothing to forgive, Legolas.
They smile at each other, their friendship renewed.

Turn around. Turn around. Take us south!
TREEBEARD looks to him, perturbed.
TREEBEARD
South? But that will lead you past

PIPPIN smiles.
PIPPIN
Yes. Exactly. If we go south we can
slip past Saruman unnoticed. The
closer we are to danger, the farther we
are from harm. It’s the last thing he’ll
expect.

You want to know what happened to
Boromir?

...that meant something. Even if you
were too small to understand why.
HIGH WIDE ON: The waters completely flood the RING OF
ISENGARD...to the very edges...wiping out everything SARUMAN
had done...preparing the land for a renewal.
(CONTINUED)
209.
 
CONTINUED:
SAM (V.O.) (CONT’D)
But I think, Mr. Frodo, I do understand.
I know now.
EXT. OSGILIATH - DAY
ANGLE ON: SAM stands overlooking OSGILIATH.
SAM (CONT’D)
Folk in those stories had lots of
chances of turning back only they
didn’t. They kept going because they
were holding on to something.
FRODO
(skeptically)
What are we holding on to, Sam?
SAM looks at FRODO...SAM walks over and lifts FRODO to his feet.
SAM
(resolute)
There’s some good in this world, Mr.
Frodo. And it’s worth fighting for.
CLOSE ON: FRODO is moved by SAM’S determination. He smiles
grimly.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR approaches them. SAM stiffens at his approach.
He kneels to their level.
FARAMIR
I think at last we understand one
another, Frodo Baggins.
MADRIL APPROACHES FROM BEHIND FARAMIR. FARAMIR stands to face
him.
MADRIL
You know the laws of our country,
the laws of your father. If you let
them go, your life will be forfeit.
CLOSE ON: FARAMIR looks at MADRIL, unwavering.
(CONTINUED)
210.
 
CONTINUED:
FARAMIR
Then it is forfeit. Release them.
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at FARAMIR with gratitude...SAM shakes a
RANGER’S hand from his shoulder.
EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY
WIDE ON: The fleeing URUK-HAI run from HELM’S DEEP over a ridge
into the PLAINS...standing on the other side of the ridge is a
large forest. The URUK-HAI run directly for it.
ANGLE ON: THÉODEN, ARAGORN, ÉOMER, and the rest of the ROHIRRIM
ride to the top of the ridge and stop.
ÉOMER
Stay out of the forest! Keep away from
the trees!
ANGLE ON: ÉOMER looks with fear at the forest that has sprung
up.
ANGLE ON: Inside the forest, the URUK-HAI charge between the
trunks mindlessly.
WIDE ON: The DEFENDERS OF ROHAN watch silently from atop the
ridge as the last of the URUK-HAI runs in. Suddenly, the trees
move. Scream emit from with the forest...
ANGLES ON: the DEFENDERS look on in fear and surprise as the
forest eliminates the last of their enemies.
EXT. HELM’S DEEP HALL - DAY
ÉOWYN and the other WOMEN and CHILDREN emerge. ARAGORN climbs
the steps to meet ÉOWYN at their summit. She looks upon him with
delight and holds him.
EXT. HELM’S DEEP BATTLEMENTS - DAY
SOLDIERS pile the bodies of the dead URUK-HAI.
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS walks through the carnage and spots GIMLI,
smoking his pipe. He stops, stroking his bow.
(CONTINUED)
211.
 
CONTINUED:
LEGOLAS
Final count...42.
GIMLI
(mock admiration)
Forty-two? That’s not bad for a
pointy-eared Elvish princeling. I
myself am sitting pretty on 43.
ANGLE ON: LEGOLAS’ face drops...suddenly, he fires an arrow at
the URUK that GIMLI sits upon.
LEGOLAS
Forty-three.
GIMLI
He was already dead.
LEGOLAS
He was twitching.
GIMLI
He was twitching because he’s got my
axe buried in his nervous system.
GIMLI demonstrates by working the axe in the URUK’S head. The
hands and feet twitch as he does.
EXT. ISENGARD - DAY
MERRY and PIPPIN stand waist-deep in the water.
MERRY
He doesn’t look too happy, does he?
PIPPIN
Not too happy at all, Merry.
ANGLE ON: SARUMAN and WORMTONGUE look hopelessly down from their
prison.
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN watching them near the outer wall.
MERRY
Still, I suppose the view would be
quite nice from up there.
(CONTINUED)
212.
 
CONTINUED:
PIPPIN
Oh, yes, it’s a quality establishment.
I hear the staff are very good.
MERRY holds his hand out from his head, measuring his height
against PIPPIN’S. PIPPIN catches this out of the corner of his
eye. MERRY pretends to be playing with his hair.
PIPPIN
What are you doing?
MERRY
Nothing. The world’s back to normal,
that’s all.
PIPPIN
No, it isn’t. I’m starving.
MERRY picks up a floating basket and tosses out its contents.
MERRY
Good luck trying to find something
decent to eat around here. Probably
dead rats and moldy bread.
PIPPIN picks up a floating apple. He looks to the sky for a
moment trying to figure out where it came from. Suddenly, he
sees another....and another...
MERRY sees what is happening. They follow the trail of apples
until they find a turkey...and then a basket of apples...and
then...
JACKPOT! The HOBBITS look with rapt anticipation at the food
storehouse in the WALL OF ISENGARD.
MERRY (CONT’D)
Saruman’s storeroom!
CLOSE ON: TWO BARRELS LABELED FROM THE SOUTHFARTHING OF THE
SHIRE!
ANGLE ON: MERRY and PIPPIN look with reverent awe on the
barrels.
PIPPIN
I don’t believe it.
(CONTINUED)
213.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
MERRY
It can’t be.
ANGLE ON: They crack open the top of one of the barrels.
MERRY (CONT’D)
It is!
PIPPIN
Longbottom Leaf.
MERRY takes a huge sniff of it.
MERRY
(with pleasure)
The finest pipe-weed in South Farthing.
PIPPIN
It’s perfect. One barrel each.
PIPPIN suddenly stops.
PIPPIN (CONT’D)
Wait. Do you think we should share it
with Treebeard?
MERRY
Share it?
(shaking his head)
No. No. Dead plant and all that. Don’t
think he’d understand.
He leans into PIPPIN.
MERRY (CONT’D)
(quietly)
Could be a distant relative.
PIPPIN smiles.
PIPPIN
I get it. Don’t be hasty.
MERRY whips out his pipe.
(CONTINUED)
214.
 
CONTINUED: (3)
MERRY
Exactly.
(deeply)
Bah-hrum.
MERRY and PIPPIN laugh.
ANGLE ON: TREEBEARD passes close to the storeroom. He hears the
laughing and looks in on them.
CUT TO:
EXT. OSGILIATH - DAY
FARAMIR leads FRODO, SAM, and GOLLUM through the turmoil to a
water logged tunnel.
FARAMIR
This is the old sewer. Runs right
under the river through to the edge
of the city. You’ll find cover in
the woods there.
ANGLE ON: FRODO and SAM look at him gratefully.
SAM
Captain Faramir...you have shown your
quality, sir.
ANGLE ON: FARAMIR stands back, surprised at SAM’S words.
SAM (CONT’D)
The very highest.
FARAMIR
The Shire must really be a great realm,
Master Gamgee, where gardeners are held
in high honor.
ANGLE ON: SAM looks away, embarrassed. FARAMIR smiles.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
What road will you take once you reach
the woods?
(CONTINUED)
215.
 
CONTINUED:
FRODO
Gollum says there’s a path near Minas
Morgul that climbs up into the
mountains.
FARAMIR looks surprised. GOLLUM tries to slink away.
FARAMIR
Cirith Ungol?
FARAMIR snatches GOLLUM up by the neck and holds him against the
wall.
FARAMIR (CONT’D)
Is that its name?
GOLLUM
No. No!
FARAMIR tightens his grip.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Yes.
FARAMIR turns to FRODO desperately.
FARAMIR
Frodo, they say a dark terror dwells
in the passes above Minas Morgul. You
cannot go that way.
ANGLE ON: FRODO, rapt with indecision.
GOLLUM
It is the only way. Master says we
must go to Mordor, so we must try.
FARAMIR looks to FRODO, seemingly desperate to talk him out of
it. FRODO looks resolute again.
FRODO
I must.
FARAMIR throws GOLLUM down. He stands before FRODO and SAM.
(CONTINUED)
216.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
FARAMIR
Go, Frodo. Go with the goodwill of
all Men.
ANGLE ON: FRODO looks at FARAMIR, touched by his sincerity.
FRODO
Thank you.
FRODO starts off into the sewer...SAM follows.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM starts to slink to the sewer...FARAMIR grabs
him up by the neck again, pinning him against the wall.
CLOSE ON: FARAMIR looks at GOLLUM intently.
FARAMIR
May death find you quickly if you
bring them to harm.
GOLLUM doesn’t respond. FARAMIR throws him into the tunnel.
GOLLUM slinks away, with a final, scathing glance to FARAMIR.
INT. OSGILIATH SEWER TUNNEL - DAY
FRODO and SAM walk easily through the tunnel. GOLLUM limps
behind them.
FRODO
Come on, keep up.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM slumps to the ground, in pain. SAM stops.
SAM
Mr. Frodo didn’t mean for them Rangers
to hurt you. You know that, don’t you?
He was trying to save you, see?
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM looks up to SAM in wonder.
GOLLUM
Save me?
SAM
So there’s no hard feelings. Forgive
and forget.
(CONTINUED)
217.
 
CONTINUED:
GOLLUM
(shaking his head)
No, no, no hard feelings.
(coughing)
Gollum, Gollum. Yes, master.
SAM steps back for GOLLUM to pass.
WIDE ON: GOLLUM crawls into the culvert, following FRODO. SAM
stands back and waits for him to wriggle his way in.
GOLLUM (CONT’D)
Nice Hobbits.
SAM
Very decent of you. Very decent,
indeed, Gollum.
CUT TO:
EXT. PLAINS OF ROHAN - DAY
GANDALF, ARAGORN, LEGOLAS, GIMLI, THÉODEN, and ÉOMER ride to the
top of the rise in front of HELM’S DEEP, looking off into the
distance.
GANDALF
Sauron’s wrath will be terrible,
his retribution swift.
WIDE ON: In the far distance, the skies over MORDOR crackle and
the darkness spreads.
ANGLES ON: The others look to GANDALF as he speaks.
GANDALF (CONT’D)
The battle for Helm’s Deep is over. The
battle for Middle-earth is about to
begin. All our hopes now lie with two
little Hobbits...
EXT. ITHILIEN - DAY
GOLLUM leads FRODO and SAM through the woods.
(CONTINUED)
218.
 
CONTINUED:
GANDALF (V.O.) (CONT’D)
...somewhere in the wilderness.
SAM
I wonder if we’ll ever be put into
songs or tales.
FRODO
What?
SAM
I wonder if people will ever say,
“Let’s hear about Frodo and the Ring.”
And they’ll say “Yes, that’s one of my
favorite stories. Frodo was really
courageous, wasn’t he, dad.” “Yes, my
boy, the most famousest of Hobbits. And
that’s saying a lot.”
FRODO laughs and turns to SAM.
FRODO
Well, you’ve left out one of the chief
characters: “Samwise the Brave.” I
want to hear more about Sam.
FRODO turns to SAM. SAM smiles sheepishly. FRODO’S smile fades.
He stops and turns to SAM, seriously.
FRODO
Frodo wouldn’t have got far without
Sam.
SAM
Now Mr. Frodo, you shouldn’t make fun.
I was being serious.
FRODO
(smiling)
So was I.
FRODO walks onward.
CLOSE ON: SAM, dreaming of being a great storybook hero.
(CONTINUED)
219.
 
CONTINUED: (2)
SAM
(dreamily)
“Samwise the Brave.”
He gives his backpack a heave and follows FRODO.
ANGLE ON: FRODO smiles...The HOBBITS walk through the forest
in the distance.
FRODO
Sméagol!
SAM
We’re not gonna wait for you. Come
on!
PAN TO: GOLLUM crawls over a short hill, struggling.
SMÉAGOL
Master. Master looks after us. Master
wouldn’t hurt us.
GOLLUM
Master broke his promise.
SMÉAGOL
Don’t ask Sméagol. Poor, poor Sméagol.
GOLLUM
Master betrayed us. Wicked. Tricksy.
False. We ought to wring his filthy
little neck. Kill him! Kill him! Kill
them both. And then we take the precious
and we be the master!
SMÉAGOL runs and hides behind a tree.
SMÉAGOL
But the fat Hobbit, he knows. Eyes
always watching.
GOLLUM peeks out from behind the other side of the tree.
GOLLUM
Then we stabs them out. Put out his
eyeses and make him crawl.
(CONTINUED)
220.
 
CONTINUED: (3)
SMÉAGOL nods eagerly.
SMÉAGOL
Yes! Yes! Yes!
GOLLUM
Kill them both.
SMÉAGOL
Yes! No! No!
He backs away from the tree.
SMÉAGOL
It’s too risky. It’s too risky.
ANGLE ON: The HOBBITS come over the rise behind GOLLUM.
SAM
Where is he? Where’s he gone? Hey,
Gollum! Where are you?
FRODO
Sméagol?
GOLLUM
(thoughtfully)
We could let her do it.
SMÉAGOL
Yes. She could do it.
GOLLUM
Yes, precious, she could. And then
we takes it once they’re dead.
SMÉAGOL
Once they’re dead.
GOLLUM
Shh.
With a smile, GOLLUM leaps out of hiding.
(CONTINUED)
221.
 
CONTINUED: (4)
SMÉAGOL
Come on, Hobbits. Long ways to go
yet. Sméagol will show you the way.
ANGLE ON: GOLLUM walks through the forest, FRODO and SAM close
behind.
GOLLUM
(sinister)
Follow me.
WIDE ON: GOLLUM continues leading the HOBBITS through the forest
to their eventual destination.
PAN UP OVER THE FOREST...OVER EPHEL DÚATH...TO REVEAL...
MORDOR...THE TOWER OF BARAD-DÛR WITH THE EYE OF SAURON BURNING
ON ITS SUMMIT...MOUNT DOOM BELCHES FIRE AND ASH INTO THE
SKY...NAZGÛL ON FELLBEASTS CIRCLE THE SKIES...
FADE TO BLACK.
