# SpaghettiMovieCalculator
A calculator to figure out how many cans of alphabet spaghetti it would take to write a movie script.

## How to use

1. Run the program,
2. Type the entire movie name you want to see,
3. Wait for the program to return the data!

## How to add more movies

1. Download a movie script and create a new .txt file with the movie script inside,
2. Add the movie name into the movies dictionary one line 35, the format should be:

| Title | File Name |
| ------ | ---- |
| The Bee Movie | BeeMovie
| The IrishMan | irish |

3. Run the program and ensure that all the data displays properly!

## Limitations at the moment

At the moment, the script wont accomodate for:

 - Stage directions,
 - Movie information at the top of the page
 - The title for who says what
 
Whether this stuff should or shouldn't be counted is personal opinion but for simplicity's sake I've left it in there.

Alongside this, the final amount is based on one single can and not an average. With more data I'd be able to adapt the program to find an average. This might be a feature in the future if I somehow find more data on this.
